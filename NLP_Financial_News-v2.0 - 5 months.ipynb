       "      <td>17 Hours Ago | 02:56 \\nEmerging markets soared more than 33 percent in 2017, and Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com says the rally won't stop. \\nA big part of the rally in emerging markets, tracked by the emerging market ETF EEM , was a weak dollar. And given that Gordon still sees the inverse relationship between EEM and the dollar, measured in his charts by the dollar-tracking ETF UUP , he believes the U.S. currency will continue to help the group. \\n\"We have a falling U.S. dollar, which will support international and emerging market currencies and will give those EEM stocks a boost,\" Gordon said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" The U.S. dollar in 2017 posted its worst annual performance in 14 years, while EEM saw its best performance since 2013. \\nAs for how high the latter could go, Gordon says EEM has broken \"resistance\" at around $45, which was the ETF's 2014 highs. That $45 region is now what he calls \"support,\" and he sees it rallying to $50, which the ETF hasn't hit since mid-2011. \\nTo play for a move higher, Gordon suggested buying the February 48/50 call spread for 72 cents, or $72 per options contract. This means that if EEM closes above $50 on Feb. 16, then Gordon could make a maximum reward of $128 on the trade. \\nBut if EEM were to close below $48, then Gordon would lose the $72 he paid for the trade. As a result, Gordon wants to establish a point at which to get out. \\n\"If the 72 cent premium we just laid out gets cut in half to about 36 cents, let's cut the trade and move on,\" he said. \\nEEM started the year off strong, rallying more than 1 percent on Tuesday.</td>\n",

The bet has been spread across several of the firm’s most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments. \\nFounders and Thiel, 50 years old, are well-known for early investments in companies like Facebook Inc. FB, +2.81% that sometimes take years to come to fruition. The bitcoin bet is quickly showing promise. Founders bought around $15 million to $20 million in bitcoin, and it has told investors the firm’s haul is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the digital currency’s ripping rise in the past year. \\nIt isn’t clear if Founders has sold any of its holdings yet.

Kotb will continue co-hosting the 10 a.m. hour of Today with Kathie Lee Gifford. \\n“It’s 2018 and we are kicking off the year right because Hoda is officially the co-anchor of Today,” said Guthrie, 46, who announced the news during the program’s opening moments. \\nKotb, 53, quickly filled in as co-host when Lauer was fired on Nov. 28 after a female colleague complained to NBC officials about a pattern of inappropriate sexual behavior that began while they were on assignment at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia , according to the network. \\nAt least two other women went to NBC with similar complaints against Lauer following the first allegation. None of the women has been publicly identified. \\n“Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I’m committed to beginning that effort,” Lauer said after he was fired . \\nReuters has not independently verified the accusations. \\nKotb joined NBC News in 1998 as a correspondent and has co-hosted the fourth hour of Today with Gifford since 2008. She also hosts a program on Sirius XM satellite radio. \\n“Over the past several weeks, Hoda has seamlessly stepped into the co-anchor role alongside Savannah, and the two have quickly hit the ground running,” NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack said in an email to staff, according to Today.com.

       "      <td>May 31, 2018 / 7:59 AM / Updated 2 minutes ago Japan Post Insurance ready to buy short-term Italian debt: CIO Tomo Uetake , Hideyuki Sano 3 Min Read\\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Post Insurance Co, one of the largest Japanese institutional investors, is looking to buy short-term Italian government bonds after the recent sell-off made them inexpensive, its chief investment officer said.\\nThe firm, also known as Kampo, holds 76.8 trillion yen ($707 billion) of assets and has limited exposure to Italian debt after having reduced its holdings by two-thirds before the country’s election on March 4, Atsushi Tachibana told Reuters.\\n“We are looking to buy short-term Italian bonds now,” Tachibana said, adding that he expects volatility to remain high and present good buying opportunities when the market overreacts.\\nKampo’s current Italian debt exposure amounts to 1 percent of its total foreign debt holdings. That would suggest about 70 billion yen ($644.5 million) based on its latest disclosure, which puts its holdings of foreign bonds at around 7 trillion yen.\\n“We thought Italian political risks were underestimated when the two-year Italian yield was so close to the German yields ahead of the election,” Tachibana said.\\nThe two-year Italian debt yield was around minus 0.10-0.20 percent, compared to minus 0.60 percent, just before the inconclusive election.\\nIt spiked to almost 3 percent on Tuesday, marking the biggest one-day rise since 1992, after the two anti-establishment parties clashed with the country’s president who rejected their choice of an eurosceptic economist as finance minister.\\nTachibana said Japan Post sought to buy some Italian bonds on Wednesday only to be hindered by wide bid-offer spreads.\\n“The market seemed to be overreacting. I don’t think Italy would default on its debts.”\\nKampo is the insurance arm of formerly state-owned conglomerate Japan Post Holdings and has been increasing investments in riskier assets since it was partially privatized in 2...</td>\n",

And given that Gordon still sees the inverse relationship between EEM and the dollar, measured in his charts by the dollar-tracking ETF UUP , he believes the U.S. currency will continue to help the group. \\n\"We have a falling U.S. dollar, which will support international and emerging market currencies and will give those EEM stocks a boost,\" Gordon said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" The U.S. dollar in 2017 posted its worst annual performance in 14 years, while EEM saw its best performance since 2013. \\nAs for how high the latter could go, Gordon says EEM has broken \"resistance\" at around $45, which was the ETF's 2014 highs. That $45 region is now what he calls \"support,\" and he sees it rallying to $50, which the ETF hasn't hit since mid-2011. \\nTo play for a move higher, Gordon suggested buying the February 48/50 call spread for 72 cents, or $72 per options contract. This means that if EEM closes above $50 on Feb. 16, then Gordon could make a maximum reward of $128 on the trade. \\nBut if EEM were to close below $48, then Gordon would lose the $72 he paid for the trade. As a result, Gordon wants to establish a point at which to get out. \\n\"If the 72 cent premium we just laid out gets cut in half to about 36 cents, let's cut the trade and move on,\" he said. \\nEEM started the year off strong, rallying more than 1 percent on Tuesday.   \n",

       "306238  May 31, 2018 / 7:59 AM / Updated 2 minutes ago Japan Post Insurance ready to buy short-term Italian debt: CIO Tomo Uetake , Hideyuki Sano 3 Min Read\\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Post Insurance Co, one of the largest Japanese institutional investors, is looking to buy short-term Italian government bonds after the recent sell-off made them inexpensive, its chief investment officer said.\\nThe firm, also known as Kampo, holds 76.8 trillion yen ($707 billion) of assets and has limited exposure to Italian debt after having reduced its holdings by two-thirds before the country’s election on March 4, Atsushi Tachibana told Reuters.\\n“We are looking to buy short-term Italian bonds now,” Tachibana said, adding that he expects volatility to remain high and present good buying opportunities when the market overreacts.\\nKampo’s current Italian debt exposure amounts to 1 percent of its total foreign debt holdings. That would suggest about 70 billion yen ($644.5 million) based on its latest disclosure, which puts its holdings of foreign bonds at around 7 trillion yen.\\n“We thought Italian political risks were underestimated when the two-year Italian yield was so close to the German yields ahead of the election,” Tachibana said.\\nThe two-year Italian debt yield was around minus 0.10-0.20 percent, compared to minus 0.60 percent, just before the inconclusive election.\\nIt spiked to almost 3 percent on Tuesday, marking the biggest one-day rise since 1992, after the two anti-establishment parties clashed with the country’s president who rejected their choice of an eurosceptic economist as finance minister.\\nTachibana said Japan Post sought to buy some Italian bonds on Wednesday only to be hindered by wide bid-offer spreads.\\n“The market seemed to be overreacting. I don’t think Italy would default on its debts.”\\nKampo is the insurance arm of formerly state-owned conglomerate Japan Post Holdings and has been increasing investments in riskier assets since it was partially privatized in 2...   \n",

Kane was left alone in the slot and, after taking the feed from Joe Pavelski, ripped a shot past John Gibson’s glove during a five-on-three power play.\n",
      "Kane was at it again with 6:09 remaining in the middle frame. He took a pass from Pavelski while the pair enjoyed a two-on-one rush and hit pay dirt with a backhander. Kane, who collected nine goals and 14 points in 17 games with the Sharks after a trade-deadline swap with the Buffalo Sabres, is the first player in Sharks history to score twice in his NHL playoff debut.\n",

      "Subban’s 12th goal of the season came at 9:48 of the second period, shortly after a faceoff win by Ryan Johansen. The puck came to Mattias Ekholm, who teed up Subban at the left point for a slapper that squirted through the pads of rookie goalie Ken Appleby.\n",
      "Ekholm added insurance at 5:36 of the third period with his seventh marker, thanks in large part to Viktor Arvidsson. After firing a shot wide of the net to start the sequence, Arvidsson provided a jump screen on Ekholm’s blast from the left point and appeared to deflect the puck past Appleby, although the goal was given to Ekholm.\n",
      "Arvidsson then ended remaining suspense at 15:11 with a shorthanded goal, his 15th of the season. Subban took the puck away and set up Arvidsson for a slapper.\n",
      "Rinne and the Nashville defense took care of the rest, although New Jersey didn’t offer much in the way of a threat. Missing Taylor Hall (hand) and Marcus Johansson (concussion), two of their top forwards, the Devils managed a meager 12 shots on net through two periods.\n",
      "New Jersey did create a good scoring chance just under 12 minutes into the game, but Rinne smothered John Moore’s wrister from the slot. Nico Hischier managed four shots on net, but few of his teammates were dangerous against the Predators’ strong defense.\n",
      "The result gave Nashville a point in eight straight games, six of which have been wins, and allowed it to tie Winnipeg for first place in the Central Division. Meanwhile, the Devils dropped their fourth straight game.\n",

      "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Thoma Bravo, a leading private equity investment firm, today announced an innovative deal to acquire the premier vehicle management and reimbursement platforms of Motus and Runzheimer. The combined organization - with approximately 2,000 customers and more than 220,000 end users - is positioned to better serve the rapidly growing needs of the addressable fleet market and provide customers with significant alternatives to today's \"company car\" or limited vehicle reimbursement options.\n",
      "The proliferation of mobile devices and cloud capabilities has created an increasingly mobile workforce, expanding the definition of those that drive for work beyond the historical context of truck and delivery drivers. As more drivers take to the road to do their jobs, fleet solutions have flourished into a $2+ billion industry, one that demands technologies that improve mobile workforce efficiency and maximize driver productivity. Integrating Runzheimer's 80+ years of expertise and world-class customer base with Motus' cutting-edge technology means the combined organization can more aggressively compete with large traditional fleet solutions and providers of company cars by providing customers with innovative products and solutions that empower true mobile workforce optimization while reducing vehicle program costs.\n",
      "\"As employee mobility continues to rise, the need for solutions that are tailored to address the unique challenges that drivers and their employers face has emerged,\" said Craig Powell, CEO of Motus. \"Forward-thinking customers want more than just a mileage reimbursement solution – they want access to a broad array of solutions and data analytics that enhance overall fleet productivity. Bringing Motus and Runzheimer under one roof creates the opportunity to better meet this demand by providing the advanced tools businesses need to better run their fleets.\"\n",
      "\"This is an exciting day for the fleet market,\" said Rex Runzheimer, Chairman of Runzheimer. \"Customers will get the best of both worlds – Runzheimer's more than 80 years of expertise and market leading service delivery and Motus' technology-first approach.\"\n",
      "This transaction will enable the combined organization to extend technology investments into areas to provide customers with the most accurate data available and best-in-class data security and privacy protections. Through these enhancements, the combined organization expects to be able to improve management capabilities and increase product functionality for existing Fortune 500 customers such as Bosch, Coca-Cola Bottling Company Consolidated, Kellogg's, National Grid and Papa Johns.\n",
      "\"It's a rare moment in our business when we have an opportunity to simultaneously combine two world-class companies like Motus and Runzheimer,\" said A.J. Rohde, a Partner at Thoma Bravo. \"Combined scale will enable us to invest in new applications, both organically and inorganically. Couple this with Thoma Bravo's operational processes and integration expertise, and we believe this will be a huge win for current and future customers alike. Working with our new CEO Craig Powell and an A+ executive team will help us deliver on that premise from day one.\"\n",
      "Canaccord Genuity Inc. served as the financial advisor to Thoma Bravo and Motus. Robert W. Baird & Co. served as the financial advisor to Runzheimer. Goodwin Procter LLP served as legal counsel for Thoma Bravo. Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. served as legal counsel for Motus, and Godfrey & Kahn, S.C. as legal counsel for Runzheimer. Financing for the transaction was provided by TPG Sixth Street Partners and Owl Rock Capital.\n",

      "PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Alpine skiing’s first ever Olympic team event threw up enough surprises and excitement on Saturday to suggest that the parallel slalom format will be back at future Games, even if some of the world’s best skiers decided to give it a miss.\n",
      "Alpine powers Switzerland, Austria and Norway won gold, silver and bronze respectively in a quickfire 16-nation knockout competition consisting of a series of head-to-head races with two men and two women on each team - a contrast with the usual spectacle of skiers racing down the course one by one.\n",
      "“It’s a completely new discipline. For the people, it’s exciting to watch. Most of the time we are (racing) for ourselves, that’s why it’s really special to compete as a team,” Denise Feierabend of Switzerland told reporters.\n",
      "Judging by the response of the skiers themselves and the crowd at the Yongpyong Alpine Centre, there was enough drama to make up for the absence of slalom specialists like American Mikaela Shiffrin and Austria’s Marcel Hirscher, who decided to call it a day after their individual events in Pyeongchang.\n",
      "“It’s a cool event, to race against another guy in one run,” said Marco Schwarz of Austria. “I think they missed something,” he said of the absentees.\n",

Mandatory Credit: Soobum Im-USA TODAY Sports For Clement Noel of France, who were edged out of bronze medal position by Norway, ”it was a super event, it was a great ambiance and a great course and crowd.\n",
      "“All the (Winter Olympic) disciplines have team events - biathlon, cross-country and so on - and I think this kind of team race is fun to have for the spectators, and fun for us to do.”\n",
      "Winners and losers alike said they hoped the experiment would be repeated in Beijing in four years’ time, and there is even talk of a parallel individual event.\n",
      "“It’s new, and we’re still working out the kinks, but both elements - of racing someone head-on-head and being able to train and race with the boys - are super-fun and so I‘m happy to be here,” said Megan McJames of the United States, who were unexpectedly knocked out in the first round by Great Britain.\n",
      "Britain’s Dave Ryding was quick to squash the suggestion he might have found it frustrating that the Americans had put out a less than full-strength team on the women’s side.\n",
      "“It’s absolutely great for us. Shame on them for not doing it. I mean we stepped up, we put out our strength, we took it seriously. Even if they had Shiffrin we could still have done it,” he said.\n",

      "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish sport’s governing body said on Tuesday its computers had been hacked into by the Russian group Fancy Bears, who accessed and published the records of doping tests performed on its athletes.\n",
      "A wide range of sports have been hit by doping controversies in recent years, while hacking attacks have also become more frequent - sometimes providing greater transparency into the doping problems in cycling, track and field and other events.\n",
      "Russia was banned from sending a national team to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang in February due to its systematic doping abuses. All Russian track and field athletes bar one and the weightlifting team were banned from the summer games in Rio in 2016.\n",
      "“The information is mostly mail conversations, but material and lists from Swedish anti-doping work has also been published,” the Swedish Sports Confederation said in a statement.\n",
      "It said the attack was by the Fancy Bears hacking group, which has been linked by Western governments and security experts to a Russian spy agency blamed for some of the cyber operations that marred the 2016 U.S. election.\n",
      "Fancy Bears said on its website that the documents showed some Swedish athletes were breaking anti-doping rules. It did not immediately respond to an emailed request for more information.\n",
      "The Confederation said the attack was aimed at discrediting its anti-doping activities.\n",
      "Fancy Bears has been blamed for an attack on the IAAF, the governing body of global athletics, in early April.\n",
      "The group was also blamed for an Olympics-related hack in 2016, when the World Anti-Doping Agency said it stole and published confidential medical information on athletes.\n",

      "NEW YORK (AP) — Kenneth Chenault, the chairman and CEO of American Express, is retiring at the end of January after a 17-year run as the head of one of the nation's most well-known brands.\n",
      "Chenault recently sat down with The Associated Press for his last interview before his retirement. He discussed key moments at AmEx, his legacy and what comes next. Here are excerpts from that interview, which have been edited for length and clarity.\n",
      "AP: What do you see as your legacy at the company?\n",
      "Chenault: This is something I've always felt but, over the last 10 years, has come in to more stark relief. You can generate good company performance over a two-year period or a five-year period. You can go through positive cycles; you can go through down cycles. But what really matters is: How does a company perform over the long term?\n",
      "I believe that we've created a culture that will endure. And, for me, my most important legacy is not just the achievements over the last 37 years, but how this company will perform 5, 10, 15, 20 years from now.\n",
      "AP: What do you make of the fact your competitors often hire former American Express executives to run their own credit card businesses?\n",
      "Chenault: What you hear from (people who left) is, 'I haven't been able to replicate the experience that I've had at American Express.' The problem is, they don't have our business model. They don't have an integrated payment platform and what they don't have, from a culture standpoint, is 168 years of this service ethic and this mission.\n",
      "While we have populated the industry, what people have not been able to export is the uniqueness of our brand which gives us a major advantage. And very importantly, the fact that we have an integrated diversified business model and that's given us a major advantage.\n",
      "AP: Did you ever want to work somewhere other than American Express?\n",
      "Growing up, I had no interest in business. I wanted to be a leader. I wanted to make a meaningful difference in people's lives. I grew up in the height of the Civil Rights Movement. I saw myself more in the social/political sector. There was no game plan or roadmap that I developed that I would go into business.\n",
      "I can honestly say that I was approached prior to becoming CEO during my tenure as CEO by larger companies. Some people would say, \"Boy, that's a great opportunity,\" but when I thought about the alignment of my personal values with the values of American Express, it wasn't even a question of whether I would stay there. I never seriously considered any other place or any other opportunity.\n",
      "AP: Your departure reduces the number of African American CEOs at Fortune 500 companies to three. What legacy would you talk about tied to that role you play in society, and also in business?\n",
      "Chenault: Here's what's very important and I think I've been very clear is, that's embarrassing. It's embarrassing because there are thousands of people who are just as qualified or more qualified than I am who deserve the opportunity, but haven't been given the opportunity. People overcomplicate this issue. One is you need a pipeline of people coming in. You need to create an environment where people are embraced and engaged rather than just tolerated.\n",
      "You need to, in fact, develop people strategies just as you do for business strategies. And you need to put metrics in place, and hold people accountable for making progress. And I must admit, I was encouraged the first few years that I was CEO because we saw an emergence (of more minority CEOs). You started to see some movement. And that has slowed down.\n",
      "Company boards and management have to say: 'diversity and inclusion is a core priority. And it's not a flavor of the month. It's not something we're just going to try for a year or two. We're going to keep at it until we get it right.' And I think we need that level of intensity and focus.\n",
      "AP: You're joining the board of Facebook. What do you hope to bring to the company?\n",
      "Chenault: I've known Mark (Zuckerberg) for at least eight years. And one of the things that I've talked to Mark about, and I believe he's fully committed to, is to build something that's enduring, that's going to make a meaningful difference in people's lives and a meaningful difference in our society.\n",
      "I think that Mark recognizes Facebook's importance of developing communities, but also understands the responsibilities. One of the things that excited me about the Facebook opportunity is the ability to help him achieve that vision.\n",

      "PARIS (Reuters) - French activist and former actress Brigitte Bardot said many actresses sexually provoke film producers to win roles and then complain about harassment to get attention. \n",
      "Her comments come a week after fellow French actress Catherine Deneuve sparked an outcry by saying a backlash against men following the Harvey Weinstein scandal had gone too far. She referred to the #Metoo campaign against sexual harassment as puritanism. \n",
      "Bardot, one of France’s most famous figures, was quoted by weekly magazine Paris Match as saying that most complaints of sexual harassment by actresses - not by women in general - were “hypocritical, ridiculous and pointless”. \n",
      "“There are many actresses who are coming on to producers just to get a role,” the 83-year-old one-time model was quoted as saying. “Then, just so people will talk about them, they say they have been harassed.” \n",
      "Bardot, who became famous in the 1950s, marrying film director Roger Vadim when she was 18, said talk about harassment was getting in the way of more important topics and said she had never been the victim of sexual harassment. \n",
      "“I was quite charmed when they told me I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass,” the magazine quoted her as saying. “That kind of compliment is nice.” \n",

      "Curry, the first black head of the Episcopal Church in the United States, started by quoting civil rights hero Dr Martin Luther King and powered on citing spirituals, medieval poetry and the experiences of slaves in the American south.\n",
      "“There’s power in love. Do not underestimate it. Anyone who has ever fallen in love knows what I mean,” he said at the start of an address that jolted the congregation after a long period of serene choral music and formal ceremony.\n",
      "By the end, he was referring to Harry and Meghan as “my brother, my sister,” and telling them “God love you, God bless you” before the opening notes of the soul standard “Stand By Me” started up.\n",

      "February 12, 2018 / 10:59 PM / Updated 19 hours ago Weinstein Co deal should include more funds for victims: New York AG Karen Freifeld , Jessica DiNapoli 4 Min Read NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York’s attorney general said on Monday a deal for the Weinstein Company should include a bigger compensation fund for victims of ex-chairman Harvey Weinstein, speaking a day after the state’s lawsuit scuttled a deal. The film and TV studio was close to inking a deal on Sunday to sell itself for more than $500 million to an investor group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet, a former official in President Barack Obama’s administration, when New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a civil rights lawsuit against the company. People familiar with the matter said the lawsuit put sale negotiations on hold. Schneiderman said he wants the “facts of our complaint factored into whatever deal is structured going forward.” The lawsuit does not block the sale but creates liabilities that make it difficult to finalize. A sale to Contreras-Sweet is now unlikely to advance, sources told Reuters. The Weinstein Company did not immediately return a request for comment. A representative for Contreras-Sweet declined to comment. The Weinstein Company has been seeking a deal that would spare it from bankruptcy after more than 70 women accused Harvey Weinstein, once one of Hollywood’s most influential men, of sexual misconduct including rape. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone. Schneiderman said at a press conference on Monday that he wanted to ensure a dedicated victim's compensation fund that would not be gobbled up by legal fees and other expenses. Contreras-Sweet had proposed about $30 million for victims in her initial bid made late last year, Reuters reported. ( reut.rs/2iAmw2O ) Slideshow (2 Images) A sale should also not reward executives including Chief Operating Officer David Glasser, who supervised the human resources department and was in charge of handling dozens of complaints, Schneiderman said. Contreras-Sweet’s offer called for Glasser to be the CEO of the new company, Schneiderman said. The company never launched an investigation into any of the complaints, he said. The lawsuit says that the Weinstein Company’s board and executives failed to take action after receiving complaints about harassment and discrimination from employees. “The Weinstein Company repeatedly broke the law,” Schneiderman said on Monday. “It is clear to us that the company’s management was complicit. Not only did they fail to stop it, they enabled it and covered it up.” Other bidders for The Weinstein Company have included Lions Gate Entertainment Corp ( LGFa.N ) and production company Killer Content Inc. Killer Content said in January that bankruptcy may be the best option for The Weinstein Company. The New York Times first reported in October on multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm the allegations. Since then, similar allegations have been leveled against many powerful men in business, politics and entertainment, and the #MeToo movement has emerged of victims using social media to share their stories of harassment and abuse.

      "The well-being and happiness of people in the United States took a hit in 2017, including the worst lows since the Great Recession. That's according to the annual Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index results released this month.\n",
      "Last year, America saw the greatest year-over-year decline in well-being and happiness, with 21 states receiving a lower score than in 2016. Not only did 2017 mark the biggest decline in the survey's 10-year history, but it was also the first year in which not a single state improved in well-being, explains Dan Witters, the research director of the Well-being Index.\n",
      "Each state's well-being was calculated on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 marking the lowest score and 100 the highest. The scores comprised the following five elements:\n",
      "Purpose: Liking what you do each day and being motivated to achieve your goals Social: Having supportive relationships and love in your life Financial: Managing your economic life to reduce stress and increase security Community: Liking where you live, feeling safe, and having pride in your community Physical: Having good health and enough energy to get things done daily A nationally representative sample of 160,498 adults were interviewed for the 2017 rankings, adding to the Well-Being Index's dataset of more than 2.5 million surveys since its 2008 start.\n",
      "Here are the 10 U.S. states that have the unhappiest people and the lowest well-being scores:\n",
      "10. Rhode Island (60.48)\n",
      "9. Indiana (60.39)\n",
      "8. Nevada (60.18)\n",

      "6. Kentucky (59.85)\n",
      "5. Oklahoma (59.66)\n",
      "4. Mississippi (59.59)\n",
      "3. Arkansas (59.36)\n",
      "2. Louisiana (58.93)\n",
      "1. West Virginia (58.80)\n",
      "Western Virginia reported the lowest levels of well-being for the ninth consecutive year, while Louisianna fell to its lowest rank in the 10-year history of the Well-Being Index. Residents in West Virginia reported a low financial well-being score and hold the spot as the lowest scoring state for physical well-being.\n",
      "\"By looking through the data, there's an inescapable pattern that enters the picture. It's not physical fitness that has worsened, but the mental, emotional and psychological aspects of well-being that have worsened,\" Witters tells CNBC Make It.\n",
      "With even the highest ranking states reaching Well-Being Index scores of only mid-60s out of 100, Witters says \"there is plenty of work to be done from a well-being perspective everywhere.\"\n",
      "For example, the percentage of people who said they frequently worry is up 32 percent, matching the previous high last experienced in 2009. Witters also saw a sharp uptick in people reporting little interest or pleasure in doing things up 7 percent or 17 million more people in 2017 than in 2016.\n",
      "Diagnoses of clinical depression also reached the highest level since the Well-Being Index started: 11 percent of people reporting they are currently being treated for depression.\n",
      "Witters points out that even with decreased obesity rates, more people are reporting feeling physical pain on a daily basis. \"Physical pain can be a psychosomatic manifestation since mental health is currently worse and can lead to side effects like headaches,\" Witters said.\n",
      "As highlighted in the Well-Being Index report, many of the states which showed declines in well-being scores in 2017 worsened on the same set of metrics, including the following:\n",
      "A sharp uptick in reporting \"little interest or pleasure in doing things\" A decline in perceiving \"positive energy\" from friends and family members A reduction in having \"someone who encourages you to be healthy\" A drop in reports of liking \"what you do each day\" A decrease in those who have a leader in their lives who make them \"enthusiastic about the future\" Satisfaction with standard of living (compared to peers) People in these low well-being states also tend to have a hard time setting and achieving goals in their life, Witters adds.\n",
      "While millennials led the way in reducing smoking among Americans, improving exercise rates and eating more well-balanced diets than other generations, Witters explains that they have fallen behind on their social and mental well-being.\n",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California will block the transport of petroleum from new offshore oil rigs through its state, officials told Reuters, a move meant to hobble the Trump administration’s effort to vastly expand drilling in U.S. federal waters.\n",
      "California’s threat to deny pipeline permits for transporting oil from new leases off the Pacific Coast is the latest step by states trying to halt the biggest proposed expansion in decades of federal oil and gas leasing. Officials in Florida, North and South Carolina, Delaware and Washington, have also warned drilling could despoil beaches, harm wildlife and hurt lucrative tourism industries.\n",
      "“I am resolved that not a single drop from Trump’s new oil plan ever makes landfall in California,” Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, chair of the State Lands Commission and a Democratic candidate for governor, said in an emailed statement.\n",
      "The administration has scheduled too few public meetings in California to get input on the proposed offshore drilling plan, the lands commission contended on Wednesday in a letter, seen by Reuters, that was sent to an official at the U.S. Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). The letter urged the bureau’s program manager Kelly Hammerle to withdraw the draft proposal and noted that only one hearing has been scheduled in the entire state of 40 million people.\n",
      "”It is certain that the state would not approve new pipelines or allow use of existing pipelines to transport oil from new leases onshore,” wrote the commission, charged with permitting pipelines in California.\n",
      "California has also clashed with President Donald Trump’s administration on a range of other issues from climate change to automobile efficiency regulations to immigration.\n",
      "The Interior Department last month announced its proposal to open nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, sparking protests from coastal states, environmentalists and the tourism industry. Governors from nearly every U.S. coastal state except Alaska and Maine expressed opposition, and even Alaska’s governor requested sensitive areas be removed.\n",
      "Developing the five-year plan for offshore oil and gas leases is “a very open and public process,” Heather Swift, spokeswoman for Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, said in an emailed response to the California letter.\n",
      "“Secretary Zinke looks forward to meeting with more Governors and other coastal representatives who want to discuss the draft program,” she said, adding the bureau “has planned 23 public meetings, in our coastal states, to secure feedback directly from citizens.”\n",
      "In an interview on Tuesday, William Brown, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s chief environmental officer, said state input is taken seriously, and has resulted in past drilling plans being scaled back. He said the approval process would take two years and include an environmental review.\n",
      "PROTESTS Trump has said more offshore drilling would boost the U.S. economy and national security by reducing reliance on imported oil. Opponents have complained that Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP Plc’s Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. It took months to stop that leak, which became the largest oil spill in American history, despoiling the environment of Gulf Coast states and causing billions of dollars in economic damage.\n",
      "Offshore drilling has been restricted in California since a 1969 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara. In 2015, a spill in Santa Barbara County sent as much as 2,400 barrels of oil (101,000 gallons or 382,000 liters) onto the coast and into the Pacific, leaving slicks that stretched over nine miles (14 km).\n",
      "Zinke has said he would exempt Florida from the drilling plan to protect its tourism industry. On Jan. 24, U.S. lawmakers from Florida sent Zinke a letter pressing him to honor that pledge. The letter, signed by both Florida U.S. Senators and 22 of its 27 House members, noted that the acting chief of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management had said Florida’s coast is “still under consideration for offshore drilling.”\n",
      "Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents small and mid-sized drilling companies, said his members support the administration’s drilling plan. But, he said that if California bars oil from passing through pipelines, companies would be far less likely to seek new offshore leases there.\n",
      "Environmentalists and some elected officials plan to protest the drilling plan at a public meeting on Thursday in Sacramento. A similar meeting planned this week in Tacoma, Washington, was canceled amid protests.\n",

Nornickel, part-owned by Russian tycoon Vladimir Potanin and aluminium giant Rusal, said its 2018 output forecast from its main assets was unaffected, amid increased production of all its key metals in the first three months of the year. \"In April 2018, the first batch of copper concentrate .... at Bystrinsky GOK (Chita Copper Project) was shipped to Chinese customers,\" Sergey Dyachenko, Nornickel Chief Operating Officer, said in a statement. \"We have however reduced the 2018 production targets for the Chita project due to the ramp-up issues at the FLS and Outotec supplied equipment, which we plan to sort out in this quarter ... Overall, we confirm our 2018 targets for metal production from our own Russian feed,\" he added. Nornickel competes with Brazil's Vale SA to be the world's top nickel producer. The Russian company is also the world's largest palladium producer. Its first-quarter consolidated nickel production rose 1 percent year-on-year to 54,063 tonnes, while palladium output was 583,000 troy ounces, up 6 percent. Platinum output rose 6 percent to 138,000 troy ounces and copper production increased 18 percent to 111,598 tonnes, Nornickel said. The Bystrinsky project is now expected to produce 25,000-31,000 tonnes of copper and 90,000-110,000 ounces of gold in concentrate in 2018, Nornickel said. The previous forecast was for 35,000-40,000 tonnes of copper and 180,000-200,000 ounces of gold concentrate.

      "(Reuters) - China’s interest in reducing its trade surplus with the United States through increased energy imports could advance plans for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants and ethanol sales, said analysts and energy executives involved in developing new LNG facilities.\n",
      "Washington and Beijing stepped back from the brink of a full-blown trade war after talks last week, with the United States appearing to set aside for now its demands that China revamp key planks of its industrial policy.\n",
      "“China represents an enormous economic opportunity for U.S. LNG and ethanol exports as both products will likely see dramatic demand growth in the coming years, during which time the United States is also expected to dominate global export markets,” Katie Bays, energy analyst at Height Securities in Washington, DC, said in a note on Tuesday.\n",
      "Bays estimated that substantial LNG sales commitments could bring in $20 billion to $30 billion annually and ethanol sales could reach $5 billion to $7 billion annually. She noted, however, that the LNG and ethanol markets were not big enough by themselves to meet President Donald Trump’s goal of reducing the Chinese trade deficit by $200 billion per year.\n",
      "There are more than two dozen proposed U.S. LNG plants waiting for customer commitments to reach a final investment decision, many of them looking to China for deals.\n",
      "China overtook South Korea in 2017 as the world’s second biggest buyer of LNG behind Japan. The country, which imported 5.6 billion cubic feet per day last year, is looking to buy more low cost sources of energy, like gas, to reduce its use of coal and cut pollution.\n",
      "Charlie Cone, LNG Proprietary Analyst for energy data provider Genscape, said at least 13 percent of total U.S. LNG cargoes currently go to China. “We expect this number to grow as more U.S. firms sign long-term agreements with Chinese buyers as their nation continues to develop its gas infrastructure,” Cone said.\n",
      "Bays said a hold on the trade war could drive Chinese customers to sign new LNG contracts with Cheniere Energy Inc’s Sabine Pass or Corpus Christi facilities, Sempra Energy’s Cameron, Freeport LNG, NextDecade Corp’s Rio Grande, or Pembina Pipeline Corp’s Jordan Cove.\n",
      "“We see it as a positive development,” said William Daughdrill, director of health, safety and environmental matters at Delfin Midstream. Its chief executive was in Asia last week pursuing customers, Daughdrill said.\n",
      "Delfin is proposing a floating LNG facility in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and aiming for a final investment decision as early as this year to go ahead and produce up to 13 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of LNG for export.\n",
      "“For us, it’s strictly been about marketing to China,” said Greg Vesey, chief executive of LNG Ltd, which is developing an LNG plant in Louisiana and another in Nova Scotia in Canada. It hopes to reach a final investment decision on the U.S. project by year-end and begin exports in 2022, he said.\n",
      "“If you look at some forecasts for 2035, there are really only two places that have significant increases in LNG imports. Europe goes up about 100 mtpa and China goes up about 200 mtpa,” Vesey said.\n",
      "Texas LNG, which is proposing a 4-mtpa export facility in Brownsville, Texas, and has five early-stage agreements with Chinese customers, hopes to make a final decision next year, about six months behind its original goal.\n",
      "“Sentiment in the LNG markets is heating up again,” said Langtry Meyer, co-founder of the company. He added, however, that Texas LNG was not considering developing an import terminal in China, which would likely be needed to expand U.S. exports.\n",
      "Cheniere, which signed a long-term LNG supply deal with a Chinese firm earlier this year, this month said it would soon make a final investment decision on a third liquefaction line at its Corpus Christi, Texas, facility.\n",
      "As for ethanol, Bays at Height Securities said ethanol producers like Archer Daniels Midland Co and Green Plains Inc could benefit from negotiations with China given the political importance of corn producers to Trump, coupled with China’s need to increase ethanol imports dramatically to meet its 2020 renewable fuel objectives.\n",

      "March 21, 2018 / 5:04 AM / Updated 11 minutes ago Powell's Fed likely to raise rates, may upgrade 2018 outlook Jonathan Spicer 5 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates at its first policy meeting under Chairman Jerome Powell and may signal more hikes are coming in response to tax cuts and government spending that could further stoke a robust U.S. economy. FILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies before a Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on the The Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 1, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo The U.S. central bank projected late last year that it would lift rates three times in 2018, but some investors believe the fiscal stimulus and recent hints of inflation pressures will push policymakers to add an additional increase to the mix. The Fed is scheduled to issue its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Powell is due to hold a press conference half an hour later. Fed officials have speculated in recent weeks that the stimulus could drive more Americans into an already tight labour market and lift inflation to the central bank’s 2 percent target, or much above that level if the economy gets too hot. Yet analysts are split over whether the Fed, which is wary of an early misstep under its new leadership, will raise policy tightening expectations until more price pressures are clearly evident, especially given outside risks to the economy such as a possible global trade war. “A prudent institution would probably give more weight to the facts, at least for the moment,” Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist who is now a partner at Cornerstone Macro, wrote in a note predicting the Fed would stick with three projected rate increases for this year. The Fed’s drive to stimulate the world’s largest economy in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession is drawing to a close. It raised its benchmark overnight lending rate three times last year, to a range of 1.25 to 1.50 percent, as joblessness fell and economic growth accelerated. It is expected to raise rates by another 25 basis points on Wednesday. With futures markets anticipating another increase in June, Powell’s Fed could leave its rate outlook unchanged until then to see how the economy absorbs the $1.8 trillion in stimulus expected from the Trump administration tax cuts and planned spending. Graphic of Fed forecasts: tmsnrt.rs/2gsUVwB POWELL IN SPOTLIGHT While recent home sales and retail spending data have been on the weak side, the overall economic picture has brightened this year. Inflation has strengthened after remaining below the Fed’s target for more than five years, and there have been more hints of wage gains. The central bank is expected on Wednesday to boost its economic growth forecasts for the next few years, and could project that the unemployment rate will fall well below the current 4.1 percent, which is seen as a low but stable level. The blockbuster U.S. jobs report for February could further convince Powell and his colleagues that the Fed’s stated “gradual” rate hike path could carry on longer than previously thought. A sign of this would be a rise in the Fed’s longer-term, or neutral, expected policy rate, currently at 2.8 percent. Powell, who took over from former Fed chief Janet Yellen in early February, triggered a brief global market selloff when he told U.S. lawmakers late last month that he had grown more confident in the economic outlook. Yet worries over a new hawkish central bank are likely overblown given Powell’s cautious, consensus-building approach. Seven of the 15 Fed policymakers who will update their forecasts on Wednesday have recently indicated the fiscal stimulus could boost their expectations for the economy, rate hikes, or for both, according to an analysis of public statements. New York Fed President William Dudley, one of the most influential policymakers, said four rate increases this year would still be considered “gradual,” noting that fiscal policy is turning “quite stimulative.” The comments suggested a shift “towards a potentially faster pace of tightening ... particularly with tax cuts now implemented and with an additional fiscal boost from federal spending arriving this year,” Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note predicting that the Fed would signal on Wednesday that rates will rise four times this year.

The precious metal has fallen more than 2 percent this week on gains in the U.S. currency and a rise in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields to seven-year highs. Higher yields increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. Spot gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,288.25 an ounce by 1145 GMT, off an earlier 4-1/2 month low of $1,285.41 an ounce. U.S. gold futures for June delivery were down $4.00 at $1,287.50. The dollar has climbed nearly 4 percent this quarter on expectations that the Federal Reserve will lift U.S. interest rates further this year to curb inflation, at a time when other central banks are still keeping monetary policy loose. \"I expect further weakness in gold prices because I think the dollar can rise a bit further,\" ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele said. \"Gold prices are mainly driven by the U.S. dollar and then U.S. yields ... our year-end 10-year U.S. Treasury forecast stands at 3.2 percent, with three more Fed rate hikes.\" The euro remains under pressure, hovering near a five-month low on concerns that political developments in Italy could cause wider disruption in the common currency bloc. Political uncertainty arising out of North Korea after Pyongyang threatened to pull out of a meeting with the United States was likely to limit downside for gold, analysts said. But that was not enough to offset dollar strength. From a technical perspective, gold prices were looking vulnerable to further losses after breaking below key chart levels this week, according to analysts who study past price moves to determine the future direction of trade. \"Gold has eroded key support, namely the 200-day moving average, the $1,302.74 March low and the 50 percent retracement (of the December-to-January rally),\" Commerzbank said in a note on technicals. \"We have been forced to neutralise our outlook as the market is now on the defensive.\" Among other precious metals, silver was up 0.3 percent at $16.40 an ounce, having touched its lowest in two weeks at $16.17 in the previous session. Platinum was down 0.2 percent at $885.60 an ounce, off an earlier five-month low of $880.50, while palladium was 0.2 percent lower at $981.80 an ounce.

The dollar hit a five-week high versus a basket of currencies, lifted by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy on Tuesday. A strong dollar makes dollar-priced gold costlier for investors using other currencies. Spot gold was flat at $1,317.94 per ounce by 1:34 p.m. EST (1834 GMT) and was poised to close February down 2 percent. On Tuesday, it hit the lowest since Feb. 9 at $1,313.26. U.S. gold futures settled down 70 cents or 0.1 percent, at $1,317.90 per ounce. \"Even though the dollar is stronger and Treasury yields are higher, the gold market oversold itself yesterday, and now we're recovering a bit,\" said Walter Pehowich, executive vice president of investment services at Dillon Gage Metals. Powell noted in his speech that recent data had strengthened his confidence that inflation will rise. . Inflation generally supports gold, which is considered a safe store of value when price pressures rise. But raising interest rates to fight inflation makes the non-yielding metal less attractive. World stocks tumbled as dismal Chinese and Japanese manufacturing and industrial output data added to the bearish equities sentiment sparked by the U.S. interest rate hike views after Powell's comments. Elevated U.S. debt levels and volatility in stocks could boost gold prices above $1,400 longer-term, according to a Reuters survey of analysts. Spot gold is expected to break support at $1,317 per ounce and fall to the next support level at $1,303, as suggested by its wave pattern and a projection analysis, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said. \"People are looking to buy gold on dips, so I think it will be supported down at $1,300,\" a Hong Kong-based trader said. Silver lost 0.2 percent to $16.39 an ounce, close to a 5.2 percent monthly decline. Palladium rose 0.8 percent at $1,043.70, but headed for a 2 percent monthly drop. Platinum was flat $983.10 per ounce, after dropping to a two-week low of $972.50, declining 2 percent for the month.

      "India could show further signs of economic recovery when it reveals its growth figures for the October to December quarter on Wednesday.\n",
      "Economists polled by Reuters predicted that India's GDP grew 6.9 percent year on year for the three months ended December.\n",
      "If that number is realized, the country would notch its fastest growth rate for the calendar year 2017, following the 6.3 percent achieved in the July to September quarter. India's fiscal year runs from April to March.\n",
      "Market watchers said that the December quarter growth was likely driven by increased consumption and higher exports. The uptick in inflation had little impact on household spending for the quarter while growth in the agriculture sector likely slowed, they said.\n",
      "\"From an expenditure perspective, consumption and external demand picked up further while private capex remained sluggish,\" economists at Morgan Stanley wrote in a recent note. The investment bank also predicted that GDP grew by 7 percent on-year for the December quarter, a touch above the market consensus.\n",
      "They said that growth in the industry and services sector likely accelerated while the agriculture sector slowed. Meanwhile, corporate revenue trends likely improved further in the quarter, the economists added.\n",
      "The Reuters poll also predicted that India's gross value-added — another metric used to measure growth — rose 6.6 percent year on year for the December quarter.\n",
      "In previous quarters, India's growth had slowed as the economy adjusted to two major currency and tax reforms the government introduced in recent years.\n",
      "show chapters The Indian government is 'too optimistic' in its GDP projections 11 Hours Ago | 02:17 Economists at Singapore's DBS bank said in a note that a rebound in growth was likely helped by a jump in industrial production, and factory activity recovered from a lull that followed India's introduction of a goods and services tax last year.\n",
      "In December, India's factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in five years on the back of rising output and new orders. Meanwhile, industrial output for the month rose 7.1 percent on-year, beating a market forecast of 6.2 percent.\n",
      "\"Net external trade is expected to benefit from firmer service sector receipts, even if the merchandise deficit is widened on a bigger oil bill,\" the DBS economists added.\n",
      "In recent months, India's economic conditions have become less favorable due to rising oil prices — crude petroleum is one of India's largest imports .\n",
      "Analysts at Mizuho Bank said in a note that higher oil prices in 2018, along with a wider trade deficit and inflation pressure, could see India face headwinds to growth.\n",
      "\"What this means is that straight-line projections of India's growth restoration to \"Modi magic\" rates of 8-8.5 percent will be misguided,\" the analysts said.\n",
      "\"Instead, a fairly bumpy ride in the 7-8 percent growth range for 2018 could be due as high oil prices, lingering banking woes and political distractions appear,\" they added.\n",
      "Earlier this month, Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said he expected GDP to top 8 percent in the near future as he outlined the government's plans to stimulate economic growth.\n",

      "(Adds bipartisan group of senators leaving meeting, Pompeo, federal government details)\n",
      "WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of federal workers began shutting down operations on Monday with the U.S. government closed, as a bipartisan group of senators tried to negotiate a deal just hours before the full Senate planned another vote to restore funding.\n",
      "As government employees prepared for the first weekday since the shutdown began at midnight Friday, U.S. senators were to vote at midday on a funding bill to get the lights back on in Washington and across the government until early February.\n",
      "Support for the bill was uncertain after Republicans and Democrats spent the weekend trying to strike a deal, only to go home for the night short of an agreement.\n",
      "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell late Sunday rescheduled an overnight vote on a measure to fund government operations through Feb. 8, for 12 p.m. EST (1700 GMT) on Monday.\n",
      "At the U.S. Capitol, a group of bipartisan senators met on Monday morning in search of a deal but came out disagreeing on whether progress was made.\n",
      "\"Were in a pretty good space right now,\" Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said as she left the meeting. But Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said senators remained in a stalemate.\n",
      "White House legislative director Marc Short told the Fox Business Network he did not believe the Senate would get the 60 votes needed to move on funding legislation that would reopen government.\n",
      "\"I think that that pressure is building, but I'm not sure we'll quite get to 60 today,\" he said.\n",
      "President Donald Trump continued blaming Democrats for the funding lapse, citing their demand that protections for young illegal immigrants be included in any deal.\n",
      "\"The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good,\" the Republican president said on Twitter.\n",
      "Democrats have accused Trump of backing out of a number of deals after pressure from immigration hard-liners. The president has not appeared in public since the shutdown began.\n",
      "Federal employees received notices on Saturday about whether they were exempt from the shutdown, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said. Depending on their schedules, some were told to stay home or to go to work for up to four hours on Monday to shut their operation, then go home. None will get paid.\n",
      "Up until Monday, most federal workers were not directly affected by the shutdown that began at midnight on Friday.\n",
      "Federal government operations varied from agency to agency, with a number of critical functions continuing. The shutdown will not interrupt combat operations in Afghanistan and other military activities, the Defense Department said, and federal law enforcement officers remained on duty.\n",
      "U.S. cybersecurity functions were continuing, Mulvaney said, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo told the \"CBS This Morning\" program that agency operations were not affected.\n",
      "Markets have absorbed the shutdown drama over the last week, and on Monday morning world stocks and U.S. bond markets largely shrugged off Washington's standoff even as the dollar continued its pullback. U.S. stocks were mixed in early trading.\n",
      "'DREAMERS' DRAMA\n",
      "The U.S. government has not been shut down since 2013, when about 800,000 federal workers were put on furlough. That impasse prevented passage of a needed funding bill centered on former Democratic President Barack Obama's healthcare law.\n",
      "The problem this time focused on immigration policy, principally President Donald Trump's order last year ending an Obama program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which gave legal protections to \"Dreamer\" immigrants.\n",
      "The \"Dreamers\" are young people who were brought to the United States illegally as children by their parents or other adults, mainly from Mexico and Central America, and who mostly grew up in the United States.\n",
      "Trump said last year he would end DACA on March 5 and asked Congress to come up with a legislative fix before then to prevent Dreamers from being deported.\n",
      "Democrats have withheld support for a temporary funding bill to keep the government open over the DACA issue. McConnell extended an olive branch on Sunday, pledging to bring immigration legislation up for debate after Feb. 8 so long as the government remained open.\n",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer objected to the plan and it was unclear whether McConnell's pledge would be enough for Democrats to support a stopgap funding bill.\n",
      "Republicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate, where they have a slim 51-49 majority. But most legislation requires 60 Senate votes to pass, giving Democrats leverage.\n",
      "Congress failed last year to pass a complete budget by Oct. 1, the beginning of the federal fiscal year, and the government has been operating on a series of three stopgap spending bills.\n",

Tomomi Nakamura, a corporate executive vice president, will take over as Subaru’s president after the shareholder meeting in June and Chief Executive Officer Yasuyuki Yoshinaga will vacate his role as president to become chairman, the report said.

The Japanese automaker had earlier vowed to reinvent itself by improving oversight of its final inspections after it revealed in October that uncertified staff had carried out tests of new cars for the domestic market for decades. The revelation described final inspections of new vehicles that occurred at the company’s main Gunma complex in north of Tokyo in violation of transport ministry norms and eventually led to the recall of 395,000 vehicles.

      "FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake The verdict by a Los Angeles jury came down in the case of 68-year-old Joanne Anderson, who was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a form of cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, and marked the second trial loss for J&J over similar allegations.\n",
      "Of the $21.7 million the jury awarded in compensatory damages, J&J was assigned 67 percent, with the rest distributed among other defendants.\n",
      "J&J has vehemently denied that its talc products contain asbestos or cause cancer, citing decades of testing by independent laboratories and scientists. But plaintiffs claim that asbestos and talc, which are closely linked minerals, are intermingled in the mining process, making it impossible to remove the carcinogenic substance.\n",
      "Anderson and her husband in 2017 had sued J&J, a unit of Imerys SA ( IMTP.PA ), Cyprus Amax Minerals, a unit of Brenntag ( BNRGn.DE ), Honeywell International ( HON.N ) and other local talc suppliers, but it was not immediately clear which of those companies were subject to the remaining damages award.\n",
      "Damages could still grow as the jury debates whether to award punitive damages, Anderson’s lawyer, Chris Panatier, said, declining to comment further.\n",

      "ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss airline Belair, formerly part of collapsed low-cost carrier Air Berlin ( AB1.DE ), has been taken over by German investment company SBC. \n",
      "SBC, based in Duesseldorf, said on Monday it wanted flights to resume as soon as possible and former Belair staff would be offered their jobs back after it made a deal with Air Berlin’s administrators. \n",
      "A spokesman for SBC declined to say how much it paid for the low-cost Swiss airline, which had sales of around 90 million Swiss francs ($93.47 million) in 2016. \n",

      "March 8, 2018 / 2:56 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Italian president calls on parties to act responsibly after vote Isla Binnie 4 Min Read ROME (Reuters) - Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Thursday called for politicians to act responsibly as they jockey to form a government after the inconclusive March 4 election. FILE PHOTO: Italian President Sergio Mattarella leaves at the end of his consultations at the Quirinale Palace in Rome, Italy, December 10, 2016. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo Mattarella, who is usually limited to a ceremonial role but must now step into the political ring and broker a deal between rival forces, made the appeal in his first public statement since Sunday’s vote delivered a hung parliament. “We - and this means everyone - still need and will always need this approach: a sense of responsibility that allows us to make the general interest of the country and its citizens the priority,” Mattarella said in a speech. No party or group won a majority, pitching Italy into political uncertainty just as European authorities warned against increasing spending and driving up an already massive debt pile. A right-wing alliance dominated by the euroskeptic League won the most seats, followed by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which emerged as the biggest single party by a wide margin. Both 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio and the League’s Matteo Salvini have laid claim to the prime minister’s job. But the final decision rests with the often-inscrutable president, who must persuade political foes to find common ground. Senior League lawmaker Giancarlo Giorgetti said he did not rule out any of the available alliances, but saw Di Maio and Salvini as “two alternative leaders”. The center-right could work with the defeated Democratic Party (PD) to write a new electoral law and hold fresh elections, he said, but would clash on policies, particularly the center-right’s pledges to impose a flat tax and review European treaties. A short-term deal to govern with the PD “could make sense, but not to write the budget, because honestly our views on fundamental questions, like Europe and taxes, would make it complicated,” Giorgetti told RAI state radio. Former premier Silvio Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party was unexpectedly beaten into second place in the center-right camp by the League, wrote to his party’s successful candidates on Thursday. “I intend to do everything possible ... to allow Italy to get out of this stalemate, to give itself a government, to get moving again on the path of growth, responsibly and safely.” BUDGET All the main parties campaigned on pledges to cut taxes, hike spending and raise the budget deficit from levels agreed with the EU, while simultaneously promising to cut debt. Aware that the threat of deterioration in Italy’s public finances could weigh on the euro, the EU’s executive had a word of warning for Italy’s leaders on Thursday. “Especially for Italy, a country that has the second-highest debt-to-GDP ratio after Greece in the EU, it’s important to stay on course as regards responsible fiscal policies,” European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said. Italy usually issues economic and public finance targets in April, before formally drawing up the budget bill in September, but the election has disrupted that calendar. Instead, the Treasury will send its forecasting document to Brussels as usual next month, but will base its budget and economic projections on current trends and existing policies. It will be up to the new government, once it is formed, to issue the budget targets.

      "March 19, 2018 / 8:34 AM / Updated 18 minutes ago Amid Brexit deal talk, EU summons envoys, media Gabriela Baczynska 4 Min Read BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU Brexit negotiators summoned national envoys and journalists at short notice on Monday as speculation mounted among diplomats of an interim deal to grant Britain a transition — though some urged caution. Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis and European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier are seen ahead of a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir “There could be a deal,” one senior EU diplomat said. Another, however, played down talk that good progress in negotiations with Britain over the weekend had covered enough ground to assure London of a transition deal after Brexit. A major sticking point is Britain’s reluctance to agree to terms on the Irish border set out in a separate part of the draft withdrawal treaty currently under discussion. Britain has been hoping for an interim accord on the transition to ease fears among businesses before Prime Minister Theresa May meets fellow EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on Thursday. The following day, the other leaders are expected to agree terms for talks on future trade relations and May hopes that they will also endorse the interim accord on transition. Member states’ representatives in Brussels were summoned to an urgent meeting by the bloc’s Brexit negotiators on Monday, diplomats and officials said. It was convening shortly before British Brexit Secretary David Davis was due to arrive about 11 a.m. (1000 GMT) to meet EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. The European Commission scheduled a news conference on Brexit for 12:45 p.m. Officials did not immediately confirm that it would be given by Davis and Barnier. They have typically spoken together after rounds of negotiation have concluded. Their teams negotiated into the night on Saturday and Sunday to clear outstanding issues and — London hopes — secure a status-quo adaptation period of about two years after Brexit, which is due in March 2019. Several EU officials and diplomats said the intense weekend talks aimed, among other things, at resolving serious differences over the Irish border had made good progress. Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis and European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier pose ahead of a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir But one senior EU source involved in discussions said talk of a deal being agreed already was “hype”. Spokesmen for Barnier and the British government declined official comment. Slideshow (2 Images) The transition period is crucial for businesses and sterling has weakened several times in recent weeks as Barnier warned that negotiations were slow and the transition was not a given. But talks have intensified since and the EU has said Britain was giving ground to ensure the transition agreement. Differences over how to avoid border checks on the island of Ireland have emerged as the key remaining obstacle. The EU says a border between the Republic of Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland would be unavoidable since London has said it will also be leaving the bloc’s single market and customs union. But both sides are determined to avoid erecting border checks again, fearing it could reignite violence the island experienced for decades. Britain says the Irish settlement should only be decided as part of a future agreement between Britain and the bloc on their new relations following Brexit and the end of the transition period. London has proposed using top-notch technology to make the checks seamless but the EU dismisses that as unrealistic.

U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis waits for the arrival of Qatari Defense Minister Khalid Bin Mohammed Al-Attiyah at the Pentagon in Washington, U.S. April 18, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n",
      "The annual Shangri-La Dialogue, delegates say, will be an opportunity for Mattis and other regional officials to look beyond North Korea and address other pressing issues, especially China’s recent moves to further consolidate its extensive territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will give the meeting’s keynote speech on Friday, and is likely to lay out his country’s expanding security role in the Indo-Pacific.\n",
      "India has gradually stepped up its naval activity across the Indian Ocean to balance China’s rising presence. Modi is expected to advertise India’s interest in developing port infrastructure in the region.\n",
      "“It will not be a surprise if Korea emerges as the single most important topic at the Shangri-La Dialogue,” said Tim Huxley, executive director for Asia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which organises the conference.\n",
      "“But it will not overshadow other very important crises in the region,” he said.\n",
      "Among them, Huxley said, were China’s growing assertiveness in the South China Sea, and what part the United States would play in Asia.\n",
      "“There is a big question mark about that role now in light of the America-first policy,” he said.\n",
      "Mattis is likely to only make glancing references to the proposed summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12, according to U.S. officials.\n",
      "“Mattis will likely be vague on North Korea; his focus will be on a broader U.S. strategy and regional security issues,” said a U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n",
      "Mattis said last week of the summit: “The diplomats are in the lead and in charge, and we give them our best wishes to have a fruitful way forward.”\n",
      "Greg Poling, director of Washington’s Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Mattis needed to show that the United States could address more than just North Korea.\n",
      "The United States must demonstrate that it is “capable of focusing on other challenges, including the South China Sea and the threat of economic coercion through the Belt and Road Initiative and all of these slow-moving crises, even though North Korea is an immediate concern,” he added. REGIONAL ALLIES\n",
      "The U.S. military has put countering China and Russia at the centre of a new national defence strategy that will set the Pentagon’s priorities for years to come.\n",
      "Experts are looking to Mattis for more details on what exactly that means in practical terms for the U.S. military.\n",
      "A trickier question is how Washington will manage seeking Beijing’s cooperation on North Korea while simultaneously reining in its behaviour in the South China Sea and over self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims.\n",
      "“This is a balance dynamic every administration has to deal with, but we really haven’t seen the Trump administration talk through that yet,” said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia under President Barack Obama.\n",
      "China’s presence at the dialogue will be typically low-key; the country will be represented by Lieutenant General He Lei, vice president of the Academy of Military Science of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, who also represented Beijing last year.\n",
      "The Trump administration had vowed a more assertive approach towards China than Obama’s over issues such as the South China Sea. But critics say that it has allowed China to continue setting the agenda, and that Pentagon actions have for the most part been largely symbolic reactions to Chinese moves.\n",
      "On Sunday, two U.S. Navy warships sailed near South China Sea islands claimed by China, the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategically important waters.\n",
      "It came at a sensitive time, amid trade negotiations and just days after the Pentagon withdrew an invitation to China to attend a major U.S.-hosted naval drill.\n",
      "On North Korea, Mattis is expected to meet his South Korean and Japanese counterparts on the sidelines of the conference, where he is likely to reiterate that the United States is committed to its allies and ask them to continue to pressure Pyongyang.\n",
      "Both countries have expressed concern that Trump may put U.S. security interests ahead of theirs in pursuing a deal with North Korea.\n",
      "Speaking with reporters while flying on Tuesday to Hawaii, where he stopped before going to Singapore, Mattis said his message would be that relations in the Indo-Pacific region had to be based on international laws.\n",
      "“Those shared principles include respect for sovereignty and independence... peaceful resolution of disputes without any coercion, free and fair trade and investment without practicing predatory economics against poorer countries trying to develop,” Mattis said.

      "March 13, 2018 / 3:26 PM / Updated an hour ago Israelis divided over military drafting of ultra-Orthodox Jews Elana Ringler 3 Min Read JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A decades-old exemption of ultra-Orthodox Jews from compulsory military service is a deeply divisive issue in Israel at the heart of a cabinet crisis that could lead to an early election. Israeli ultra-Orthodox Jewish men clash with police as they block a main road during a protest against the detention of a member of their community who refuses to serve in the Israeli army, in Bnei Brak, Israel, March 12, 2018. REUTERS/Ammar Awad A preliminary vote in parliament on a new bill that would maintain the exemption is expected on Tuesday. One faction in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s six-party coalition government has vowed to defy him and oppose the legislation. That could cause Netanyahu’s government to unravel, setting the stage for the possible dissolution of parliament and a snap election in which he would seek a new mandate to help survive corruption allegations threatening his political survival. The exemption enjoyed by ultra-Orthodox seminary students has long caused friction in Israel, where Jewish women and men are called up for military service at the age of 18. Army service for most lasts for two to three years and many who do not enlist perform alternative national service in the community, at schools, hospitals, and different organizations. The ultra-Orthodox, or Haredim, say their study of the Torah is vital for the continued survival of the Jewish people and also fear that young men serving in the army would stray from the religious path. Outside a military recruitment office in Jerusalem, 16-year-old Hananel Twito, a Haredi Jew, said his community has suggested he opt out of army service. “I received a draft notice. For now, I still want to check. At the age of 18 I’ll choose if I want to be recruited or not. For now, I’ve postponed because I still want to check if it’s worth going or not,” Twito said. Last September, Israel’s Supreme Court gave parliament a year to pass a new conscription bill after declaring parts of the existing exemption unconstitutional. Many Israelis feel the exemption is simply unfair. Many Haredi men who devote themselves to religious studies do not have jobs and rely on state stipends and benefits. “You are a part of this nation, you will take part of this burden,” said David Cohen, a 26-year-old technician. Haredim make up about 10 percent of Israel’s population of 9 million. Smadar Goldstein, who runs an education company in Jerusalem, said all Israelis should enlist to defend their country.“They should go into the army, why shouldn’t they? There’s no reason any more. I’m a religious Jew as well; my son is going into the army next year,” she said. Writing by Maayan Lubell; Editing by Jeffrey Heller/Mark Heinrich\n",

      "A new report from Axios reveals just how far President Donald Trump is taking his law and order rhetoric. \n",
      "Late Sunday, Axios reported that Trump “loves” the notion of imposing capital punishment on drug dealers—an approach taken by the Philippines, Singapore, and China. Trump reportedly references the approach frequently, saying, “When I ask the prime minister of Singapore do they have a drug problem, the prime minister replies, ‘No. Death penalty.’” The report suggests that Trump thinks drug dealers are “as bad as serial killers,” and believes that more lenient drug policies “will never work.” \n",
      "Capital punishment for drug dealers is arguably most associated with the brutal campaign of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte whose “drug war” has, according to Human Rights Watch , resulted in more than 12,000 deaths to date. And Trump’s reported endorsement of the tactic is his latest nod to the authoritarian leader, a deference that critics find troubling \n",

      "April 20, 2018 / 7:15 PM / Updated an hour ago Many U.S. kids with brain injuries not getting needed rehab Lisa Rapaport 5 Min Read \n",
      "(Reuters Health) - Many children hospitalized in the U.S. for brain injuries don’t receive all the rehabilitation services needed for them to potentially make a full recovery, a new study suggests. \n",
      "Researchers interviewed parents and children four times over two years after kids had a head injury. Overall, children with moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries had greater functional impairments and required more rehab services than kids with mild injuries. \n",
      "But severely injured kids were also more likely to get the help they needed, while more than one in four children with mild brain injuries failed to receive necessary services like educational support, mental health care and treatment from physiatrists – doctors who specialize in addressing brain and spinal cord conditions. \n",
      "“Mild brain injuries are more common than moderate to severe brain injuries, so there are a greater number of children who may be at risk of having unmet health care needs after being hospitalized for a mild brain injury,” said study leader Dr. Molly Fuentes of the University of Washington School of Medicine and Seattle Children’s Research Institute, Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development. \n",
      "“If children are waiting for services to help them recover or learn how to adapt to their new impairments, not only are their long term functional outcomes at risk of being poorer, they are also missing time in school (making it harder to catch back up) and other activities that are an important part of their development,” Fuentes said by email. \n",
      "There’s a big difference between brain injuries in adults and children, Fuentes added. \n",
      "While adults recovering from a head injury must strive to get back to where they were before they got hurt, children and teens get hurt while their brains are still developing, and so they need to work on both recovery and continuing to develop into mature adults mentally and physically. \n",
      "Previous studies have found that less than half of kids hospitalized for brain injuries get rehab during their hospitalization, and very few kids get sent to outpatient rehab facilities when they leave the hospital, researchers report in Pediatrics. \n",
      "Fuentes’ team interviewed parents and kids one month after the children left the hospital, and again at six, 12 and 24 months. \n",
      "The analysis included 123 children hospitalized with mild traumatic brain injuries and 47 kids with moderate to severe head injuries. Car crashes were the most common cause of the brain injuries, although many of the milder cases were caused by falls. \n",
      "After moderate to severe brain injuries, the most common problems were physical, cognitive and academic challenges, with more than half of parents reporting these issues during each follow-up interview. \n",
      "Among children with milder injuries, academics, mental health problems and cognitive challenges were the most common problems, reported by one third of parents. \n",
      "As time passed, the need for educational support increased and a growing number of kids had unmet needs for academic help and for treatment from specialists in recovery from brain injuries, the study found. \n",
      "Younger children in the study, ranging in age from 8 to 11, were more likely to receive all of the necessary rehab services than older kids. \n",
      "Children with pre-existing brain conditions were also more likely to receive all of the necessary services after their injuries than kids who didn’t have these health problems before they got hurt. \n",
      "The study wasn’t designed to prove whether or how the receipt of rehab services might directly impact recovery for children who have traumatic brain injuries. \n",
      "Another limitation is that researchers relied on children and parents to accurately recall and report on kids’ abilities before they got hurt, and those perceptions might not always be accurate, researchers note. \n",
      "Even so, the results add to growing evidence suggesting that many children don’t get the long-term help necessary to fully recover from brain injuries, said Dr. Jack Tsao, a researcher at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and the Memphis Veterans Affairs Medical Center. \n",
      "“It matters as children have inherent neuroplasticity and intensive therapy can improve cognitive outcomes, so not getting the rehab needed could adversely affect clinical outcomes and child development,” Tsao, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. \n",

      "CHICAGO (Reuters) - A federal judge has temporarily blocked California’s plans to require cancer warnings on products containing the popular weed killer glyphosate, in a win for manufacturer Monsanto Co.\n",
      "U.S. District Judge William Shubb said the warnings would be misleading because glyphosate is not known to cause cancer, according to court documents filed on Monday in California. He still allowed the state to keep glyphosate on a list of cancer-causing products.\n",
      "“Given the heavy weight of evidence in the record that glyphosate is not in fact known to cause cancer, the required warning is factually inaccurate and controversial,” Shubb wrote.\n",
      "The judge’s decision is important for Monsanto because warnings could discourage use of glyphosate, which is widely used by farmers on genetically engineered crops and by consumers on lawns. The company’s agricultural productivity segment, which includes glyphosate, had net sales of $3.7 billion in fiscal-year 2017.\n",
      "Monsanto, which is being acquired by Bayer AG, and U.S. farm groups sued California in November to stop the warnings.\n",
      "The state added glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto’s herbicide Roundup, to its list of cancer-causing chemicals in July 2017 and had planned to require that products containing the chemical carry warnings by July 2018.\n",
      "California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) said on Tuesday its actions were lawful and that it was pleased the judge denied Monsanto’s request for an injunction against including glyphosate on the list.\n",
      "The state acted after the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded in 2015 that glyphosate was “probably carcinogenic.”\n",
      "Other studies have found the opposite, including one released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in December.\n",
      "A large, long-term study on glyphosate use by U.S. agricultural workers, published in November as part of a project known as the Agricultural Health Study, or AHS, also found no firm link between exposure to glyphosate and cancer.\n",
      "Reuters reported in June that an influential scientist was aware of new AHS research data while he was chairing a panel of experts reviewing evidence on glyphosate for IARC in 2015. He did not tell the panel about it.\n",

      "(Reuters Health) - Children who have their tonsils removed before they’re at least three years old may be more likely to have complications afterward than kids who have the surgery when they’re older, a U.S. study suggests.\n",
      "Researchers examined data on 1,817 children, ages one to six, who had tonsillectomies at hospitals in New Orleans, Louisiana, between 2005 and 2015. Overall, 95 patients, or 5.2 percent, had postoperative complications like bleeding, breathing difficulties or dehydration.\n",
      "Kids under three were 50 percent more likely to have complications than older children, the study found.\n",
      "“Based on these results, we suggest children under age 3 years undergoing tonsillectomy be considered for overnight observation after tonsillectomy rather than scheduled as an outpatient procedure,” said lead study author Dr. Claire Lawlor, a researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n",
      "Tonsillitis is an inflammation of the tonsils that makes it difficult for some kids to breathe or sleep. While it sometimes clears up on its own, doctors may recommend surgery for children who have several infections a year that contribute to breathing or sleeping problems or cause kids to miss a lot of school.\n",
      "“For children of all ages, including those under age 3 years, tonsillectomy is sometimes a necessary procedure,” Lawlor said by email. “In such children the risks of the airway obstruction for which the surgery is performed outweigh the risks of the surgery.”\n",
      "Even though medical guidelines recommend hospital admissions after a tonsillectomy for children under three as well as for underweight kids and children with breathing disorders, many of these patients still get outpatient procedures and are sent home afterwards instead of being admitted to the hospital, researchers note in JAMA Otolaryngology Head & Neck Surgery. Hospital admission rates vary widely across facilities and by patient age and other health problems, ranging from five to 90 percent of cases.\n",
      "The current study included 455 children under age three as well as 1,362 patients three and older. Most had outpatient procedures.\n",
      "Thirty-two kids under three, or 7 percent, had complications, compared with 63 kids, or 4.6 percent, among older children in the study.\n",
      "In the younger kids, 25 percent of complications occurred within the first 24 hours after surgery, compared to 9.5 percent of complications in the older children.\n",
      "Kids’ weight, however, didn’t appear to influence the risk of complications.\n",
      "The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how kids’ age might influence their risk of complications after a tonsillectomy. It’s also possible that kids who were admitted to a hospital were sicker than kids who had outpatient procedures.\n",
      "It’s also possible that the study was too small to detect meaningful differences in outcomes based on how much kids weighed, said Dr. Paul Hong of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n",
      "“However, it is fairly common for surgeons, including myself, to think that age does matter,” Hong, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.\n",
      "Age is most likely strongly linked to the size of the child, noted Dr. Neil Bhattacharyya, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study.\n",
      "“You can imagine that in a very young child, even though you take out the tonsils which may be causing obstruction as the indication for the tonsillectomy, there can be postoperative airway swelling and since the child is very young and therefore has a smaller airway, this puts them at greater risk for an airway complication such as airway obstruction or respiratory distress,” Bhattacharyya said by email.\n",
      "“The data are somewhat compelling to advocate for most if not all children under age three who undergo tonsillectomy to be admitted for an overnight observation hospital stay,” Bhattacharyya added.\n",

      "On Wednesday, the companies were hit with separate lawsuits in California state court accusing them of misclassifying workers as contractors rather than employees to save money.\n",
      "The San Francisco-based companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "Companies must pay taxes and contribute to unemployment and workers’ compensation funds on behalf of employees, pay the minimum wage and overtime as well as covering work-related expenses. Contractors can cost up to 30 percent less, according to several studies.\n",
      "So-called gig economy companies rely heavily on independent contractors to provide services to customers, and many have faced similar lawsuits in the past.\n",
      "Lyft and Postmates have already been sued by workers who say they were misclassified as contractors. Postmates paid $8.75 million to settle an earlier case while Lyft last year settled a previous case for $27 million.\n",
      "The new lawsuits cover more recent time periods.\n",
      "The California Supreme Court last week adopted a new test for determining whether workers are employees that experts say will be difficult for many companies to overcome.\n",
      "Boston attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan represented the workers who brought the previous cases as well as the plaintiffs in Wednesday’s lawsuits. She has filed similar cases against other gig economy companies, including Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and GrubHub Inc.\n",
      "“We believe that the companies’ continued classification of the workers as independent contractors in California is a willful violation of the law,” in light of the California Supreme Court’s decision, Liss-Riordan said on Thursday.\n",
      "Previously, workers in California had to show that their work was controlled by their companies, among other factors, to win on claims that they are employees rather than contractors.\n",

      "China’s opening up will not be affected by the current trade frictions with the United States, Yi said.\n",
      "Yi only weighed in briefly on the U.S.-China trade issue in an extensive interview with Caixin in Washington in late April. The PBOC governor reiterated China’s existing stance on a variety of matters including monetary policy, the opening up of its economy, the yuan and the country’s deleveraging efforts.\n",
      "He reiterated China’s commitment to its prudent and neutral monetary policy and its focus on stabilising its macro leverage ratio and reducing financial risks. On the currency front, Yi said that the PBOC has not intervened in the foreign exchange market for almost a year now, and authorities are committed to market-based foreign exchange rate reform.\n",
      "China will also push for the convertibility of the capital account to coincide with the opening up of the financial sector, Yi said. Beijing in recent weeks said it will resume two key outbound investment schemes, allowing domestic financial institutions to invest in overseas securities.\n",
      "However, in the process of opening up, China will step up the oversight of cross-border capital flows, prevent the contagion of cross-border financial risks and fend off international arbitrage, Yi said.\n",

      "The European statistics office Eurostat said the euro zone’s surplus in goods trade rose in unadjusted terms to 26.3 billion euros in November, up from 18.9 billions in October. It was also higher than the 23.8 billion surplus recorded a year earlier.\n",

      "It was not clear how the move might affect a burgeoning marijuana industry in the six states including California and Colorado that have legalized the drug for recreational use, plus dozens of others that permit medicinal use. The industry is forecast to reach nearly $23 billion in sales by 2021. \n",
      "“Let me give you a list of things more important for federal prosecutors and federal law enforcement to pursue other than marijuana: 1. Basically anything,” Democratic U.S. Congressman Ted Lieu of California wrote on Twitter. \n",
      "Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat, said the move “inexplicably” directed federal law enforcement resources away from an opioid epidemic that she said was ravaging communities. \n",
      "Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado said the decision on marijuana use must be left up to the states and that the Justice Department had trampled on the will of voters in his state and elsewhere. \n",
      "States that allow the sale of marijuana for recreational use also include Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Nevada. Maine and Massachusetts had looked likely to follow suit this year. \n",
      "At the center of the dispute is a policy under Democratic former President Barack Obama, known as the Cole Memo, that directed federal prosecutors not to interfere with state legalization efforts. \n",
      "Oregon’s governor, Democrat Kate Brown, said in a statement that more than 19,000 jobs have been created in her state in a legal market that officials had “worked carefully to build in good faith and in accordance with the Cole Memorandum.” \n",

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo Washington Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, said his state’s pot laws keep criminals out of the market, and stop the drug reaching children or crossing borders to neighboring states. \n",
      "“We are going to keep doing that and overseeing the well-regulated market that Washington voters approved,” he said. \n",
      "In Nevada, Republican Attorney General Adam Paul Laxalt said his office was reviewing the Justice Department’s letter “and evaluating the ramifications for our State.” Governor Brian Sandoval, a Republican, said he believed his state’s system was a model for others to emulate. \n",
      "Bob Troyer, U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, said in a statement his office would continue to be guided by the same principles that have long governed all their prosecution decisions: “focusing in particular on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state.” \n",
      "Sessions’ move on Thursday also raised questions about whether federal prosecutors could focus on medical marijuana programs run by states such as Pennsylvania. \n",
      "Pennsylvania’s Democratic U.S. Senator, Bob Casey, said many children were among those in the state being prescribed medical marijuana for serious illnesses, adding the Justice Department’s announcement caused “serious concerns.” \n",
      "“Bureaucrats in Washington should not interfere with the medical care these patients are receiving,” Casey said in a statement. \n",
      "But the news was welcomed by critics of cannabis who saw it as a chance to push for a crackdown on the substance, the use of which remains prohibited under federal law. \n",
      "“We are encouraged,” said Scott Chipman, the southern California chair of Citizens Against Legalizing Marijuana. “We’ll be meeting with U.S. attorneys in California and elsewhere to talk to them about the havoc being wreaked upon our teenagers and young adults.” \n",

      "The explosion unleashed ash, rocks and sulfuric odor, and was followed by rumbling sounds and a faint glow in the crater, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said in its latest bulletin.\n",
      "Phivolcs raised the alert to level 2, which means that the current activity is “probably of magmatic origin, which could lead to more phreatic eruptions or eventually to hazardous magmatic eruptions.”\n",
      "Mayon’s most destructive eruption was in February 1841, when lava flows buried a town and killed 1,200 people. It last erupted in 2014, spewing lava and forcing thousands of people to evacuate.\n",
      "“The public is strongly advised to be vigilant and desist from entering the six kilometer (3.7 mile) radius Permanent Danger Zone to minimize risks from sudden explosions, rockfall and landslides,” Phivolcs said.\n",
      "It advised people experiencing ashfall to cover their noses and mouths with a damp, clean cloth or dust mask. It also said aircraft must avoid flying close to the volcano’s summit.\n",
      "Those within the slope of the volcano, but outside the 6-km danger zone, were told to take precautionary measures against possible roof collapses due to accumulated ash and rainwater.\n",

      "March 14, 2018 / 3:13 AM / in 35 minutes China sovereign fund exits Blackstone investment after 11 years Sumeet Chatterjee , Matthew Miller 3 Min Read HONG KONG (Reuters) - China’s sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp (CIC) has sold its equity holding in Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ), the U.S. private equity firm said in a filing, ending an 11-year investment. FILE PHOTO: The ticker and trading information for Blackstone Group is displayed at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) April 4, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The original agreement with Beijing Wonderful Investments - the legal entity set up by CIC to invest in Blackstone - was struck in May 2007, just before the private equity firm’s initial public offering a month later. The pact allowed the sovereign wealth fund to own up to 9.99 percent of the private equity firm. In 2008, the wealth fund raised its stake in Blackstone to 12.5 percent, Reuters reported at that time. CIC’s exit from Blackstone comes amid growing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington since U.S. President Donald Trump took office just over a year ago. Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecoms sectors, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration said on Tuesday. “As of February 22, 2018, Beijing Wonderful Investments no longer owned any non-voting common units,” Blackstone said in its annual report filed with the securities regulator earlier this month. It did not give details. Beijing-headquartered CIC told Reuters late on Wednesday it “gradually divested” its stake in Blackstone according to “changes in the market” and as part of “a normal adjustment of its portfolio”. The sovereign fund, whose assets had surpassed $800 billion by the end of 2016 thanks mainly to stronger returns from its overseas portfolios, said the firm achieved “positive returns” from its investment. CIC and Blackstone continue to cooperate in real estate and hedge funds, as well as direct investments, it said. A Blackstone spokesman said in a separate emailed statement on Wednesday that the U.S. private equity firm continues “to expand this important relationship as one of CIC’s major asset managers,” despite the stake sale. The financial details of the stake sale were not immediately clear, and a person familiar with the matter said the sovereign fund had been gradually selling its shares over the last few years. CIC, which was founded to help China boost returns on its foreign exchange reserves, had about a 4.5 percent stake in Blackstone at the end of last year, said the person, who declined to be named as the information is not public.

      "TORONTO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Rising equity markets and clarity on U.S. tax reform could set the stage for an acceleration in Canadian mergers and acquisitions this year after a slowdown in 2017, investment bankers said. \n",
      "Canadian M&A activity slipped 6 percent in 2017 to $239.7 billion, from $255.1 billion in the previous year, data from Thomson Reuters showed on Thursday. \n",
      "While uncertainty around the tax regime weighed on deal activity in 2017, bankers expect the recently passed changes to the U.S. tax system to boost the allure of U.S. companies to Canadian firms and funds looking to make acquisitions. \n",
      "Following a sweeping overhaul under President Donald Trump, the U.S. corporate income tax rate has been cut to 21 percent from 35 percent. \n",
      "With Canadian and U.S. stocks at record highs, bankers also see buoyant equity markets supporting deals. \n",
      "“We expect 2018 to be a very strong year for M&A,” said Darin Deschamps, co-head of Wells Fargo Securities Canada. \n",
      "“You’ve got healthy economies in Canada and the United States, corporate liquidity is very robust, the banking system wants to lend, and the financing markets are very attractive,” Deschamps said. \n",
      "Still, the lack of visibility around negotiations over renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement has been holding back some potential buyers. Some experts expect the NAFTA situation to be resolved in the first half of the year. \n",
      "“There is a desire to do deals, but it’s a more difficult environment to find value in certain sectors as NAFTA negotiations add a certain level of uncertainty,” said David Rawlings, head of JPMorgan Canada. \n",
      "Some bankers said they see Trump’s threat to pull out of NAFTA if the talks fail as an opportunity for Canadian companies. \n",
      "“The risks around the continuation of the existing NAFTA agreement necessitates companies to undertake M&A to try and position themselves in a potential post-NAFTA world,” said Grant Kernaghan, Citigroup’s managing director of Canadian investment banking. \n",
      "In this environment, Kernaghan expects Canadian companies to acquire U.S. targets in the automotive, paper and telecommunication equipment sectors. \n",
      "Pension funds, among the world’s most active dealmakers, are expected to fuel deal activity as they look to invest massive capital pools. \n",
      "“The pension funds have such a large amount of money that they need to deploy on behalf of the beneficiaries that they really have to be looking at a lot of different opportunities,” said Peter Buzzi, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at ‎RBC Capital Markets. \n",
      "Last year saw a decline in outbound deals, after they peaked in 2015 and 2016. Some of the year’s biggest transactions were domestic companies picking up assets, including Cenovus Energy Inc’s C$16.8 billion acquisition of some ConocoPhillips assets. \n",
      "“The market sentiment for M&A has definitely picked up over the course of 2017,” said Geoff Barsky, BMO’s head of Canadian and international M&A.“We anticipate increased levels of outbound activity going into 2018.” (Reporting by John Tilak; Additional reporting by Matt Scuffham in Toronto; Editing by Jim Finkle and Tom Brown)\n",

      "ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Two major Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) investors on Tuesday criticised Chairman Paul Achleitner over the bank’s performance and his handling of a search for a new chief executive. Deutsche Bank supervisory board chairman Paul Achleitner gives a speech during the Swiss International Finance Forum in Bern, Switzerland June 20, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann \n",
      "Last week, Reuters and other news organisations reported that Achleitner had begun a search for a new CEO to replace John Cryan. Cryan has said he will stay on in a memo to staff, but Achleitner has so far remained silent. \n",
      "At the heart of the debate over the bank’s leadership is the future of the investment bank. \n",
      "Confidence in Achleitner has been damaged, said a major shareholder. “He makes too many excuses for strategic mistakes that fall under his responsibility,” the person said on condition of anonymity. \n",
      "Another major investor said: “The situation is a bit odd. Achleitner is obviously not controlling the process. All is a bit chaotic at the moment.” \n",
      "Both Cryan and Achleitner have been criticised for Deutsche Bank’s share price and earnings. But Achleitner, rather than Cryan, should take the blame, said the second shareholder, who also declined to be named. Deutsche Bank supervisory board chairman Paul Achleitner speaks during the bank's annual general meeting in Frankfurt, Germany May 18, 2017. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski \n",
      "A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Achleitner or Cryan’s behalf. \n",
      "A third major investor, also speaking anonymously, came to Achleitner’s defence. Asked about sentiment turning against Achleitner, the investor said: “No, this is spin”. \n",
      "The bank’s largest investors are Qatar’s royal family, Chinese conglomerate HNA, U.S. asset manager BlackRock and private equity fund Cerberus. Together they own about a third of Germany’s largest bank, which employs more than 97,000 people. \n",
      "In a March 28 message to staff made public by the bank, Cryan – whose term ends in 2020 - sought to quell talk of an imminent exit and of disagreements between him and Achleitner, saying he was “absolutely committed” to serving the bank. \n",
      "Much of the shareholder discontent focuses on the lack of clear progress at the bank, which has reported three consecutive years of losses under Cryan. Its shares have lost 30 percent of their value since the beginning of the year. \n",
      "Cryan has slimmed down Deutsche’s investment bank but it has failed to return to growth. Revenues are 25 percent lower than they were in 2015 and a string of top bankers have left. \n",
      "“It looks like there is some dispute or discussion at the board level about what is going to be the future of the investment bank,” said a fourth person with direct knowledge of the thinking of one of the bank’s biggest investors. \n",
      "“It is the question of more investment in the platform or more divestment from the platform,” the person said, saying this was a “crucial question to resolve.” \n",
      "Cryan is conducting a global review of the investment bank which could result in further job cuts or investment. \n",
      "Supporters of Cryan, which include some shareholders, credit him with settling a string of legal disputes from Deutsche Bank’s reckless expansion during the financial crisis, strengthening its balance sheet and pulling off the listing of the bank’s asset management arm. \n",
      "But Cryan himself has said turning the bank around will require time. Last month, it reported a bigger 2017 loss than previously disclosed, warned it would miss a cost-cutting target this year, and said a strong euro coupled with higher funding costs would weigh on its first quarter results. \n",
      "“There has been a steady flow of negative news on Deutsche Bank, but if you look at it closely, they’ve been making progress,” Peter Nerby, an analyst at credit rating agency Moody’s, said. Additional reporting by Andreas Framke; Editing by Edward Taylor, David Holmes and Jane Merriman\n",

      "March 13, 2018 / 1:42 PM / Updated 24 minutes ago IMF's Lagarde says cooperation needed to keep crypto-assets safe David Lawder 3 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Governments and central banks need to collaborate on developing regulations for crypto-assets to prevent them from becoming a new vehicle for money laundering and terrorist financing, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO - Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), attends a conference on \"Transforming France’s Economy and Completing the Integration of the Eurozone\" with French Treasury and the IMF at the Bercy Ministry in Paris, France, February 15, 2018. REUTERS/Charles Platiau In a blog posting ahead of a meeting of Group of 20 finance leaders next week, Lagarde said the technology behind crypto-currencies, including blockchain, offer exciting advancements that could power financial inclusion. New, low-cost payment methods could empower millions of people in low-income countries who lack traditional bank accounts. “Before we get there, however, we should take a step back and understand the peril that comes along with the promise,” Lagarde said, adding that their appeal also makes them dangerous. “These digital offerings are typically built in a decentralized way and without the need for a central bank. This gives crypto-asset transactions an element of anonymity, much like cash transactions,” she said.“The result is a potentially major new vehicle for money laundering and the financing of terrorism.” Before the July 2017 shutdown of dark web marketplace AlphaBay, some $1 billion worth of illegal drugs, hacking tools, firearms and toxic chemicals were sold through crypto-assets on the exchange, she said. Some early efforts are encouraging, including those led by the Financial Stability Board to study fintech advancements and by the Financial Action Task Force to provide guidance on electronic money laundering. She said the IMF was focused on encouraging countries to develop policies that ensure financial integrity and protect consumers in crypto-assets in much the same manner as it has done for the traditional financial sector. She also said technology behind crypto assets can be used to“fight fire with fire,” including distributed ledger technology that speed up information sharing between market participants and regulators. This can be used to create registries of standard, verified customer information and help fight cross-border tax evasion, she said. Regulators can also use biometrics, artificial intelligence and cryptography to enhance digital security and identify suspicious transactions“in close to real time”, Lagarde added. Applying the same securities rules to crypto assets as standard securities also can help increase transparency and alert buyers to potential risks. “To be truly effective, all these efforts require close international cooperation. Since crypto-assets know no borders, the framework to regulate them must be global as well,” Lagarde said. The G20 major economies will explore regulation of crypto-assets this year, including at a meeting next week in Buenos Aires for G20 finance ministers and central bank governors.

      "February 21, 2018 / 2:06 AM / Updated 20 minutes ago South Korea's cryptocurrency industry welcomes regulator's dramatic change of heart Reuters Staff 3   South Korea’s cryptocurrency industry is anticipating much better times as the market regulator changes tack from its tough stance on the virtual coin trade, promising instead to help promote blockchain technology. The regulator said on Tuesday that it hopes to see South Korea -- which has become a hub for cryptocurrency trade -- normalize the virtual coin business in a self-regulatory environment. “The whole world is now framing the outline (for cryptocurrency) and therefore (the government) should rather work more on normalization than increasing regulation,” said Choe Heung-sik, chief of South Korea’s Finance Supervisory Service (FSS), told reporters. FSS has been leading the government’s regulation of cryptocurrency trading as part of a task force. Cryptocurrency operators have drawn a new optimism from Choe’s comments, seeing them clearly indicating the government’s co-operation in their plans for self-regulation. “Though the government and the industry have not yet reached a full agreement, the fact that the regulator himself made clear the government’s stance on co-operation is a positive sign for the markets,” said Kim Haw-joon of the Korea Blockchain Association. Wednesday’s news is a stark reversal of the justice minister’s warnings in January that the government was considering shutting down local cryptocurrency exchanges, throwing the market into turmoil. Instead, South Korea banned the use of anonymous bank accounts for virtual coin trading as of January 30 to stop cryptocurrencies being used in money laundering and other crimes. Bitcoin BTC=BTSP , the world's most heavily traded cryptocurrency, is now changing hands at a three-week high of $11,086 on the Luxembourg-based Biststamp exchange after falling as low as $5,920.72 in early February.

REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo The proposed changes at the ADB’s annual meeting are similar to reforms the United States argued for at the World Bank last month that led to an increase in lending rates for developing countries with higher incomes.\n",
      "The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had chided the World Bank’s lending to higher-income countries such as China, saying they should “graduate” to non-concessional loans.\n",
      "“Some of the reform priorities that we pursued at the World Bank a few weeks ago are also things that we are prioritizing in the strategy discussion here,” a senior U.S. Treasury official told reporters on the sidelines of the ADB meeting in Manila, the Philippine capital.\n",
      "“Among those is a commitment to improving and developing a differentiated pricing strategy that encourages countries to seek financing from markets, rather than the bank, when those alternatives exist,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n",
      "He did not specifically name China, but said countries now have better access to capital markets and the ADB should wean them off its development loans. Washington also preferred that taxpayer money go to the poorest countries, the official added.\n",

      "JAKARTA (Reuters) - The developer of Indonesia’s first commercial-scale wind farm says conditions for renewable energy investors are better now than ever before, but more work is still needed for the country to achieve its wind energy targets.\n",
      "Historically, the prospects of getting commercial projects up and running in Indonesia’s renewable energy sector were bleak, with the government and state power utility lacking expertise and offering little support.\n",
      "But over the past three years, technology costs have come down and the government has become more supportive, said Soeripno Martosaputro, project development manager for UPC Renewables Indonesia.\n",
      "UPC is developing the archipelago’s first wind farm at Sidrap on the island of Sulawesi. The 75-megawatt (MW) site is expected to be operational next month, said Soeripno.\n",
      "“It was super-duper hard to get a power purchase agreement,” said Soeripno, referring to pricing agreements between independent power operators and the country’s sole power off-taker, state-owned utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN)[PLNEG.UL].\n",
      "“It used to be take it or leave it. Now there is dialogue,” said Soeripno, “It’s much, much better.”\n",
      "Online licensing systems have cut processing times, improved transparency and made it far easier for renewable energy developers, who need hundreds of permits for wind farms, Soeripno said.\n",
      "Indonesia has set targets for renewables to make up nearly one-quarter of its energy mix by 2025 from around 12 percent at present, with around 1,800 MW of wind projects targeted for completion.\n",
      "Southeast Asia’s largest economy has attractive demographics and surging power demand, but wind energy development has been sluggish compared to its neighbors.\n",
      "Thailand, for comparison, is targeting 3,000 MW of wind energy by 2036, up from around 615 MW in 2017.\n",
      "SENSITIVE PRICING Wind research began at the Sidrap site in 2005, but it was not until 10 years later that UPC obtained a power purchase agreement with PLN.\n",
      "In January 2017, the company commenced construction of foundations for 30 Siemens Gamesa wind turbines at an estimated cost of $150 million, with funding from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).\n",
      "UPC is now eyeing a power off-take deal for another 30 turbines at the same site.\n",
      "“We proposed 75 megawatts, but it’s still in negotiation. It could go bigger or lower,” Soeripno said, noting that pricing was still a “sensitive issue”.\n",
      "Indonesia has the potential to supply 9.3 gigawatts of power from onshore wind sites, according to the country’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.\n",
      "UPC has signed a memorandum of understanding with PLN and the government to develop at least 350 MW of wind farms by 2025.\n",
      "However, Indonesia will not be able to achieve its renewable energy targets if renewables must compete with fossil fuels on the same basis, Soeripno said.\n",
      "Indonesia caps the price for renewable electricity projects at 85 percent of the average electricity cost in that region. But renewables developers say this system gives coal and natural gas an unfair advantage and ignores the environmental and social impacts of fossil-fuel projects.\n",
      "PLN also limits the amount of renewable energy it buys because of strains renewable energy sources can put on aging infrastructure, Soeripno said.\n",
      "“We are still left behind with these rules that make things a bit slow to develop.”\n",

      "WASHINGTON/TORONTO (Reuters) - Western allies stepped up pressure on U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday to keep alive an international nuclear deal with Iran, with French President Emmanuel Macron due to urge him in person not to tear up the 2015 agreement.

Nazanin Tabatabaee Yazdi//File Photo \n",
      "Trump has said that unless European allies fix what he has called its “terrible flaws” by May 12, he will restore U.S. economic sanctions on Iran, which would be a severe blow to the pact. \n",
      "Macron, who arrived in Washington on Monday for a state visit, said on Sunday there was no “Plan B” for keeping a lid on Iran’s nuclear ambitions. \n",
      "Minutes after Macron’s plane touched down, the White House said it had no announcements on the Iran deal. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders added, “The president has been extremely clear that he thinks it’s a bad deal. That certainly has not changed.” \n",
      "The agreement between Iran, the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany was born of longstanding concern among major powers that Iran was seeking to develop an atomic weapon and imposed curbs on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief for Tehran. Critics of the pact, including Trump, have said it does not adequately contain Iran. \n",
      "Trump sees three defects: a failure to address Iran’s ballistic missile program; the terms under which international inspectors can visit suspect Iranian nuclear sites; and “sunset” clauses under which limits on the Iranian nuclear program start to expire after 10 years. \n",
      "German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said both Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is due to meet Trump in Washington on Friday, would urge the U.S. president to stay in the deal, which is formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Related Coverage Nuclear test ban monitor says he sees hope of Iran joining treaty \n",
      "“We believe it is extremely important to uphold this agreement. Were it to fail or the U.S. to drop out, we would not have anything comparable to it and we fear that the situation would significantly deteriorate with everything that goes with it,” Maas told reporters. \n",
      "He was speaking at a meeting in Toronto of foreign ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations. \n",
      "Britain’s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, echoed this, telling reporters in Toronto, “There is a strong view around the (G7) table that we need to make the case for the JCPOA.” \n",
      "“We accept that Iranian behavior has been disruptive in the region, we accept the president (Trump) has some valid points that need to be addressed, but we believe they are capable of being addressed (inside the deal),” Johnson said.

      "Iran has said it will stick to the accord as long as the other parties respect it, but will “shred” it if Washington pulls out. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called on European leaders on Monday to support it. \n",
      "“It is either all or nothing. European leaders should encourage Trump not just to stay in the nuclear deal, but more important to begin implementing his part of the bargain in good faith,” Zarif wrote on Twitter. \n",
      "On a visit to Beijing, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he had agreed with his Chinese counterpart to block any U.S. attempt to sabotage the deal. \n",
      "Trump’s opposition to the deal has been welcomed by Israel, which has rejected the pact since it was being hammered out under former U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration. \n",

(NASDAQ:CWST), a regional solid waste, recycling and resource management services company, announced today that it has priced two previously announced transactions relating to certain of its industrial revenue bonds.\n",
      "Casella said that it has priced the previously announced offering of $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of Finance Authority of Maine (“FAME”) Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds (Casella Waste Systems, Inc. Project) Series 2015R-2 (the “FAME Bonds”), which were issued under an indenture between FAME and the bond trustee. The FAME Bonds represent the drawdown of the remainder of the FAME 2015 solid waste disposal revenue bonds, the initial proceeds of which, in the amount of $15.0 million, were loaned to Casella in August 2015. The FAME Bonds will bear interest at a rate of 4.375% per annum for a term interest rate period ending on July 31, 2025, and will be guaranteed by all or substantially all of Casella’s subsidiaries. The FAME Bonds have a final maturity of August 1, 2035. The issuance of the FAME Bonds is expected to close on April 2, 2018. The FAME Bonds are not a general or contingent obligation of FAME, or of the State of Maine, and are payable solely from amounts received from Casella under the indenture. The net proceeds of the FAME Bonds will be loaned to Casella to enable it to finance or refinance the costs of certain of Casella’s solid waste landfill facilities and solid waste collection, organics and transfer, recycling and hauling facilities in Maine and the cost of issuance of the FAME Bonds.\n",
      "The Company also announced that it has priced the previously announced remarketing of $16.0 million aggregate principal amount of Vermont Economic Development Authority (“VEDA”) Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds (Casella Waste Systems, Inc. Project) Series 2013 (the “VEDA Bonds,” and together with the FAME Bonds, the “Bonds”). The VEDA Bonds will bear interest at a rate of 4.625% for a ten-year term interest rate period. The VEDA Bonds were originally issued on April 4, 2013 and have a final maturity of April 1, 2036. Pursuant to the indenture under which the VEDA Bonds were offered, the interest rate period under which the VEDA Bonds were previously issued is expiring on April 2, 2018 and accordingly the VEDA Bonds will be remarketed at a new interest rate for a new interest rate period. The VEDA Bonds are guaranteed by all or substantially all of Casella’s subsidiaries. The VEDA Bonds are not a general or contingent obligation of VEDA, or of the State of Vermont, and are payable solely from amounts received from Casella under the indenture. Casella has issued a notice of a mandatory tender for the VEDA Bonds with respect to the expiring interest rate period. The remarketing is expected to occur on April 2, 2018.\n",
      "The Bonds are being offered only to qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).\n",

Founded in 2000, the Company was formerly known as Bioptix, Inc. (\"Bioptix\") and changed its name to Riot Blockchain, Inc. in October 2017.\n",
      "The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Riot lacked a meaningful business plan with respect to the cryptocurrency business and had only minimal investments in cryptocurrency products; (ii) the Company changed its name to Riot Blockchain, Inc. as part of a scheme to capitalize on public interest in cryptocurrency products, thereby driving up the Company's stock price and enriching inside shareholders; (iii) Riot never intended to hold its Annual General Meetings scheduled for December 28, 2017, and February 1, 2018; and (iv) as a result of the foregoing, Riot shares traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period, and class members suffered significant losses and damages.\n",

The CNBC report noted that Riot's \"stock shot from $8 a share to more than $40, as investors wanted to cash in on the craze of all things crypto\", but that Riot did not appear to have meaningful involvement in the cryptocurrency business: \"Until October, its name was Bioptix, and it was known for having a veterinary products patent and developing new ways to test for disease.\" In addition, CNBC reported numerous \"red flags\" in Riot's SEC filings: \"annual meetings that are postponed at the last minute, insider selling soon after the name change, dilutive issuances on favorable terms to large investors, SEC filings that are often Byzantine and, just this week, evidence that a major shareholder was getting out while everyone else was getting in.\"\n",

      "By parring the final 11 holes, he forced his closest pursuers to make something happen. \n",
      "“I knew on the back nine I had a two-shot lead (and) ... if I played smart golf ... those guys would have to catch me coming in,” an emotional Potter said in a greenside interview. \n",

      "(Reuters) - Germany’s Manuel Neuer will be the first choice keeper at next month’s World Cup if he makes the final squad, team manager Oliver Bierhoff said on Thursday, even though the 2014 World Cup winner has not played a competitive game since September.

      "Neuer missed almost the entire season after breaking a bone in his foot and undergoing surgery. His comeback for Bayern Munich was repeatedly delayed and the 32-year-old has had no match practice ahead of the tournament starting in Russia on June 14.\n",
      "He played in both recent training matches against Germany’s Under-20 team at their training base in Italy and is set to play in their friendly international against Austria on Saturday.\n",
      "“Manuel will go to the World Cup as our number one,” Bierhoff told reporters at their training camp in Eppan, northern Italy.“If he makes the squad then Marc-Andre (ter Stegen) will be number two.”\n",
      "Coach Joachim Loew has picked four keepers, including Barcelona’s ter Stegen, Paris St Germain’s Kevin Trapp and Bayer Leverkusen’s Bernd Leno, for his 27-man preliminary squad, preparing in the Italian Alps.\n",
      "He will cut four players, including one goalkeeper, on Monday for his final 23.\n",
      "“Manuel is already full on track. He does not need to get back on it. All the players have left a big impression here and it is as very difficult decision,” Bierhoff said.\n",
      "“On the evening before the team announcement there will be the final thoughts among the coaching staff. By noon the next day the players will be informed.”\n",
      "The Germans also expect Chancellor Angela Merkel to drop in on their camp this week.\n",
      "“My information is that on Sunday she will drop by. Before our training camp we visited her and she had hinted that she wanted to say hello without too much fanfare,” Bierhoff said.\n",

      "LAGOS (Reuters) - A 33 billion naira ($105 million) writedown on Lafarge Africa’s ( WAPCO.LG ) operations in South Africa and Nigeria pushed the cement firm to a wider loss in 2017 than the previous year, sending its shares sharply lower.\n",
      "The one-off impairment charge left the African division of Franco-Swiss group Lafarge Holcim ( LHN.S ) with a pretax loss of 34.03 billion naira, it said on Monday, just months after making its first capital increase in a decade.\n",
      "That figure missed market forecasts and was down from a loss of 22.82 billion naira in 2016, and the division’s Lagos-listed stock fell more than 7 percent after earlier touching a one-year low.\n",
      "Its chief financial officer, Bruno Bayet, said that, after a year of restructuring, he expected 2018 to bring growth.\n",
      "“The operations in Nigeria are still very robust and we have maintained strong performance,” he told Reuters.\n",
      "Lafarge Africa’s sales rose 36 percent last year, he said.\n",
      "Nigeria’s cement industry has been hit by slow demand arising from weak economic growth in Africa’s most populous nation, which recently emerged from a recession and a currency crisis that made dollar loans more expensive.\n",
      "In South Africa, many construction firms are struggling, partly due to a slow roll-out of a government infrastructure investment package, fuelling competition.\n",
      "To cut debt, Lafarge Africa raised 132 billion naira ($420 mln) through a rights issue in November.\n",
      "Analysts had forecast profit before tax of 13.6 billion naira for 2017, according to a consensus forecast.\n",
      "“This is a negative earnings surprise. The real challenge is, are these impairments completely done or will there be more to come,” one said.\n",
      "Bayet said 12.5 billion naira of the impairment was for a road project leading to its cement plant in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar which had taken too long to construct. The rest covered restructuring costs associated with merging its Nigerian operations, and its loss-making assets in South Africa, where the firm had changed its management team.\n",

      "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s finance minister on Thursday labeled the U.S. tax law overhaul passed by Congress in December as “regressive” and said the Mexican economy would remain competitive without sweeping cuts to corporate tax rates. Mexico's Finance Minister Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya gestures during a conference at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico (ITAM) in Mexico City, Mexico January 11, 2018. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril \n",
      "The Republican-controlled U.S. Congress defied opposition from Democrats to pass the bill and give President Trump his first major legislative victory. \n",
      "The overhaul cuts taxes for corporations and the wealthy while giving mixed, temporary tax relief to middle-class Americans. \n",
      "Cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent has sparked concern among Mexican companies and some lawmakers that it could lead to less investment reaching Latin America’s second biggest economy. \n",
      "However, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya argued the changes could make the U.S. economy overheat and said his government did not want to copy Trump’s overhaul. \n",
      "“It’s a very regressive reform: the top one percent of earners will get 40 percent of the benefits,” he said at an event in Mexico City. “It’s not exactly something we want here.” \n",
      "What makes a country competitive is not simply a matter of taxation, said Gonzalez Anaya. \n",
      "“If that were the case the countries with the lowest tax take would be the most competitive,” he said, citing Haiti and Bolivia as examples in the Americas. “They aren’t exactly the most competitive countries in the hemisphere.” \n",
      "Still, automaker Fiat Chrysler said shortly after Gonzalez Anaya spoke that the U.S. tax overhaul had partially enabled the company to boost investment in its U.S. manufacturing operations and grant a bonus payment to workers. [L4N1P65G4] \n",
      "The minister said that since the United States is near full employment the overhaul’s impact on economic activity would be “limited”. It could, however, make it overheat, he added. \n",

      "DJI is ready to tighten its grip on the drone market with the new Mavic Air. Announced today at an event in New York City, the $799 Mavic Air slots right in between the company's cheapest drone (the $399 Spark) and its most capable prosumer model (the $999 Mavic Pro). It goes on sale January 28th.\n",
      "The Mavic Air is truly a blend of those two drones. From certain angles, especially from the top, it resembles a stockier Mavic Pro, while from others (the front) it looks an awful like the Spark. Like the Mavic Pro, the drone folds up for better portability. It folds up into a smaller footprint than the Spark, and it's 41 percent lighter than the Pro.\n",
      "4K video at 24 or 30 FPS, or 12-megapixel stills The specs of the Mavic Air are much closer to those of the Pro, which should please consumers who thought the Spark was too underpowered to use for filming or photography. In some ways, it almost sounds better. The Mavic Air uses a 1/2.3-inch sensor that shoots 4K video at 24 or 30 frames per second, or 12-megapixel stills, all with a wide-angle 24mm f/2.8 lens. It tops out at 42.5 miles per hour, can withstand winds of up to 22 miles per hour, and has a 2.5-mile range (within visual line of sight), thanks to a new antenna design.\n",
      "More from The Verge:\n",
      "Fitbit will end support for Pebble smartwatches in June \n",
      "Checking out the new $129.95 DJI Osmo Mobile 2 phone stabilizer \n",
      "Spire Studio is a recording studio that fits in your hand \n",
      "\n",
      "The Mavic Air also got a redesigned ventilation system that DJI says will help keep it from overheating, along with a new 3-axis gimbal casing for the camera for smooth footage. It should be relatively easy and safe to fly, too, with a seven-camera obstacle avoidance system. There's also a new remote, which is included in the $799 price.\n",
      "DJI is promising both updated and improved software features on the Air, too. There are new shooting modes (including a 32-megapixel panorama option, or a tiny planet mode), better gesture controls, and the company claims it's improved its image processing in order to squeeze better photos and videos out of that relatively tiny sensor. New obstacle-avoidance software, which calls on more sensors and better algorithms, will help the drone avoid and move past obstacles instead of just stopping in front of them, according to DJI.\n",

The Mavic Air is only capable of staying in flight for 21 minutes, which is five more than the Spark, but six short of the Mavic Pro.

      "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian states are ignoring boys in compensating child victims of sexual abuse, the federal government said on Wednesday, weeks after the government itself was criticized for overlooking males in a new law mandating tougher punishment for rapes of girls.\n",
      "“The male child, who is the most neglected victim of child sexual abuse, is being ignored for the award of compensation and needs to be included,” the Ministry of Women and Child Development said in a statement, citing letters sent to states on the issue.\n",
      "States run centrally monitored programs to compensate victims of crimes including rape and human trafficking, but sexually abused boys were not getting any financial help, the ministry said.\n",
      "The statement comes at a time when there is a debate around the treatment meted out to boy victims of sexual crimes in a country where, according to activists and police, many cases of abuse of boys go unreported because of the stigma attached to homosexuality.\n",
      "A 2007 survey by the ministry, which sampled 12,447 children in families, schools, at work and living on the street, found that more than half had faced sexual abuse, and 53 percent of victims were boys.\n",
      "Still, in an executive order issued last month, the government did not mention boys while introducing the death penalty for rape of girls below the age of 12 and increasing the minimum punishment for those whose victims were under 16.\n",
      "To correct the anomaly, the government says it plans to introduce a “gender-neutral” legislation in the next session of parliament.\n",

      "Facebook is partnering with the Atlantic Council in another effort to combat election-related propaganda and misinformation from proliferating on its service.\n",
      "The social networking giant said Thursday that a partnership with the Washington D.C.-based think tank would help it better spot disinformation during upcoming world elections.\n",
      "The partnership is one of a number of steps Facebook is taking to prevent the spread of propaganda and fake news after failing to stop it from spreading on its service in the run up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Additionally, organizations with ties to the Russian government distributed misleading information through Facebook ads in 2016 that were intended to sow divisions among Americans.\n",
      "In the months since news of the misinformation became public, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has tried to regain public trust in the company by repeatedly speaking about the company’s latest efforts to combat disinformation. Some of those efforts include partnering with news organizations like Agence France-Presse and the Associated Press to fact check news, photos, and videos.\n",
      "Facebook didn’t provide many details on how the Atlantic Council would help spot potential disinformation, only to that the think tank’s cyber forensic team would work with Facebook staff to deliver “real-time insights and updates on emerging threats.”\n",

      "Using public data posted on a web site is legal. This is the bread and butter of Internet marketing companies. But according to a recent New York Times investigation, Cambridge Analytica collected data from Facebook users and their friends without consent , leaving both companies potentially liable for their actions .\n",
      "Cambridge certainly compiled a significant amount of information from 50 million Facebook profiles. But that data pales in comparison to the quality and quantity of user information that Facebook, and especially Google , have collected over the years. This is what we should really be concerned about.\n",
      "It’s time for the government to regulate companies like Facebook before their collection practices irreparably harm users’ privacy.\n",
      "The underlying problem with Google, Facebook, and other tech companies is that they are easily able to accumulate immense amounts of information based on consent agreements, written in fine print, that users must sign to use their services.\n",
      "In Facebook’s case, it’s likely that the company creates a user profile by combining their name, age, location, photos, likes, and opinions with publicly available U.S. census information, such as average income at a specific zip code.\n",
      "Google is able to create a much more complete user profile, most of which comes from its search service. Google can identify the IP (Internet protocol) address (basically a computer’s Internet ID) of a user, match it to their physical location, and determine the residence they are accessing the Internet from. Adding in information from personal assistants such as Google Assistant and Android cell phone movement and use, Google can map much of a person’s activity throughout the day.\n",
      "At some point, it is realistic that Google will be able to know practically everything about a person. That could even extend to information about someone’s health. If Google begins to compile health data, the company could learn how often users get sick and which illnesses they suffer from. Eventually, Google might be able to predict a user’s longevity much better than an insurance company could.\n",
      "Consumers can take some actions to protect their privacy from Google. To start, they can delete all browser cookies, set their browsers to stop collecting cookies, and quit using the Chrome browser.\n",
      "Even if users do this, though, Google can still harvest data from them using their IP addresses. These addresses, assigned by a phone or cable company, are hard to change. But there are still ways around direct browser surveillance. People can use an anonymous browser like Tor, which bounces browsing signals to various parts of the world before they reach the desired website. For even more secure browsing, users can pay for a virtual private network (VPN), as many Chinese do to avoid state censorship and surveillance.\n",
      "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at Facebook's F8 Developer Conference in San Jose, California. Facebook is under fire for the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images These steps, while cumbersome, can make Google’s surveillance more difficult. But they would hardly hamper Facebook and other websites that make users “volunteer” their info. To fix that, we’ll need strict regulation of Internet companies like Facebook.\n",
      "First, we need to convert all information collection contracts to be “opt-in” and not “opt-out” by default. With an opt-in contract, Facebook would collect information only if a user consented to it. Second, companies like Facebook should be required to provide service to consumers even if they opt out of sharing info with the company. Therefore, opting in would not become a requirement for having a Facebook account.\n",
      "Third, once accounts are opt-in by default, users should be allowed to sell their data to the company. This would give users a fair choice: get paid to share information, or receive no money but still keep their account. Fourth, the transfer, copy, and sale of some very sensitive types of information should be restricted completely. For example, personal medical information should in no circumstances be moved off of the company’s servers.\n",
      "The Facebook-Cambridge fiasco is an important wakeup call, but it is likely only the beginning of a thorough examination of tech companies’ widespread collection and possibly illegal use of user data. That will take time. The best way to begin the process is for the government to begin holding companies like Facebook and Google accountable for the information they collect.\n",

      "TOKYO, May 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures rose on Monday on signs that the United States and North Korea are still working towards holding a summit next month, while oil prices extended losses on expectations of more supply from major producers.\n",
      "The euro edged up from a 6-1/2-month low but is seen vulnerable after efforts to form a coalition government in Italy, the currency bloc’s third-biggest economy, collapsed over the weekend.\n",
      "U.S. S&P500 mini futures rose 0.3 percent in early Asian trade, but market holidays in the world’s two biggest financial centres — London and New York — could make trading slow and illiquid for the day.\n",
      "Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.3 percent in early trade, while South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.5 percent, buoyed by stocks which are seen as benefiting from a further thawing in tensions with Pyongyang.\n",
      "But markets elsewhere in Asia appeared little fazed by the latest North Korean news after a week of conflicting signals from Washington. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat.\n",
      "President Donald Trump said on Sunday a U.S. team had arrived in North Korea to prepare for a proposed summit between him and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which Trump pulled out of last week before reconsidering.\n",
      "“While we can’t say for sure how much they can agree, both sides seem to want to make progress,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities.\n",
      "Mizuho sees a 10 percent chance that the summit, so far planned on June 12, will not take place, a 20 percent chance of a truce deal struck at the meeting and a 70 percent likelihood of the summit leading to more talks without producing immediate deals on denuclearisation, he said.\n",
      "Oil prices extended their decline since last Tuesday on growing expectations that major oil producers may ease their 17-month-old production cuts.\n",
      "A return to the oil production levels that were in place in October 2016, the baseline for the current deal to cut output, is one of the options for easing curbs, Russia’s energy minister said on Saturday.\n",
      "His comments came after the energy ministers of Russia and Saudi Arabia met to review the terms of a global oil supply, ahead of a key OPEC meeting in Vienna next month.\n",
      "Brent crude futures dropped to as low as $75.71 per barrel, their lowest level in about three weeks. They last stood at $76.05, down 0.5 percent.\n",
      "U.S. crude futures dropped to $67.00 per barrel, their May 1 low of $66.85 and last stood at $67.37, down 0.8 percent.\n",
      "In the currency market, the euro bounced back from a low of $1.1646 touched on Friday to trade at $1.1685.\n",
      "Italian president Sergio Mattarella rejected a eurosceptic pick for the key economy ministry by the two anti-establishment parties aiming to form a coalition government, the 5-Star Movement and the League.\n",
      "5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio, whose party won the most seats at an inconclusive March 4 vote, demanded that parliament impeach Mattarella, triggering a possible constitutional crisis and opening the prospect of fresh elections.\n",
      "The 10-year Italian bond yield has risen 67 basis points, or 0.67 percentage point, so far this month, on course to make its biggest monthly rise since late 2011.\n",
      "Its yield spread over benchmark German Bunds rose above 200 basis points for the first time in over a year.\n",
      "“If the Italian debt prices fall further, people will have to do more hedging, say by selling the euro and so on. The issue will be the biggest focus for markets this week,”\n",
      "While no one thinks the country will default, people need to make hedging when they face sharp price moves,” said Takafumi Yamawaki, head of currency and fixed income research at J.P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo.\n",
      "Investors are also increasingly wary of Spain, where Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is facing growing pressure to resign over a graft case involving his party.\n",

      "The dollar rose 0.3 percent against the yen in early Monday trade to 109.66 yen, extending its recovery from Thursday’s 108.955 on optimism on the upcoming U.S.-North Korea summit.\n",

That means Greece being back as a normal member of the euro zone and the final signal, the end of the Greek crisis.” (Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop)\\n    \n",

Let's accept that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and own that market, offering worldwide hedges on the most volatile commodity trading since the tulip craze,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \\nCramer argued that after this quarter, Goldman's stock is cheap, selling for only 10 times next year's earnings estimates after reporting a 50 percent drop in trading revenues. \\n\"Wall Street may be confused about how Goldman Sachs did this quarter.

Instead, it will probably push stocks down to buyable levels, he said. \\n\"If a shutdown does cause delays in when the IRS sends its tax rebates, we might get a temporary decline in consumer spending,\" Cramer said. \"Again, though, another buying opportunity: Home Depot , Ama...   \n",

She saw the recent wave of consolidation in the media industry—particularly 21st Century Fox’s FOXA, +1.71% agreement to sell most of its assets to Walt Disney Co.

The amount of synergy expected by CBS is well below that of Viacom. \\nThe main obstacle to the rejoining of the network and owner of Nickelodeon and MTV is a growing distrust between Redstone and Moonves. As CNBC previously reported , Moonves wants to pick his own management team if he is to head the combined entity and favors Joe Ianniello, chief operating officer of CBS, as his key lieutenant. Redstone, however, wants Bob Bakish, the current CEO of Viacom, as No. 2.

FILE PHOTO - Shari Redstone arrives for Variety's Power of Women luncheon in New York City, U.S., April 21, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\\nThe offer is an attempt by Redstone to resolve an impasse in the deal negotiations. Redstone has been trying to put together a deal that will keep Moonves, a 68-year-old media industry veteran credited with turning CBS around, at the helm, while positioning up-and-coming Bakish, 54, as Moonves’ successor.\\nMoonves has agreed to run the combined company for at least two years, as long as CBS Chief Operating Officer Joseph Ianniello will be president and chief operating officer of the combined company, so he can succeed him, sources have previously said.\\nRedstone, daughter of media mogul Sumner Redstone, has offered not to give Bakish any executive role in the combined company, but still wants him to sit on the board of directors and eventually succeed Moonves, the sources said on Friday.\\nMoonves does not want Bakish to be part of the combined company at all, because he is seeking as much autonomy as possible in running the combined company, said one of the sources.\\nAs a result of the impasse over Bakish’s role, CBS executives have serious doubts that a deal will happen, the source said. CBS and Viacom have also disagreed about the stock exchange ratio that should be used in a merger, although the two sides are making progress on that front, the sources added.

       "      <td>Two famous entertainment companies are providing excellent entertainment to fans of corporate dealmaking as they wage the weirdest takeover battle ever. As in so many popular storylines, you kind of know how it will end--but you have no idea how it will get there.\\nHere's the synopsis: CBS , the highly successful owner of the CBS TV network and Showtime, is trying to buy Viacom , the declining owner of MTV, Nickelodeon, and other cable networks that are showing their age, plus the struggling Paramount studio. Yet CBS chief Les Moonves doesn't especially want Viacom. That may be why he's pursuing the novel strategy of bidding less than Viacom's market value. In any case, both CBS and Viacom are controlled by National Amusements, which owns 80% of each. National Amusements is controlled by Sumner Redstone, 94, whose faculties have reportedly declined to the point where he communicates only through grunts. As a practical matter, the boss is now his daughter, Shari Redstone, who is the one person who unequivocally wants this deal to happen.\\nGot all that? Then why, you ask, is this a takeover \"battle\" at all? As the controlling shareholder of both companies, Shari Redstone can do whatever she wants. Except that she can't. That's because the crown jewel in this scenario is not a product or patent or film library, but a person: Moonves. And the one thing Redstone cannot do is make Moonves, 68, stay if he doesn't want to.\\nThat is why her previous attempt to merge these companies, in 2016, failed. The rationale was to put Viacom's weak business under the highly successful Moonves. But he wanted no part of it, and he's at a point in his career where he needn't accept anything he doesn't want. At a 2016 industry conference, says the Hollywood Reporter , someone asked Moonves onstage why he might oppose the merger. \"Because I'm too old and too rich. How's that?\" he replied. He tried to soften the remark by adding that he was kidding, but all evidence suggests he was not.\\...</td>\n",

       "76038   Two famous entertainment companies are providing excellent entertainment to fans of corporate dealmaking as they wage the weirdest takeover battle ever. As in so many popular storylines, you kind of know how it will end--but you have no idea how it will get there.\\nHere's the synopsis: CBS , the highly successful owner of the CBS TV network and Showtime, is trying to buy Viacom , the declining owner of MTV, Nickelodeon, and other cable networks that are showing their age, plus the struggling Paramount studio. Yet CBS chief Les Moonves doesn't especially want Viacom. That may be why he's pursuing the novel strategy of bidding less than Viacom's market value. In any case, both CBS and Viacom are controlled by National Amusements, which owns 80% of each. National Amusements is controlled by Sumner Redstone, 94, whose faculties have reportedly declined to the point where he communicates only through grunts. As a practical matter, the boss is now his daughter, Shari Redstone, who is the one person who unequivocally wants this deal to happen.\\nGot all that? Then why, you ask, is this a takeover \"battle\" at all? As the controlling shareholder of both companies, Shari Redstone can do whatever she wants. Except that she can't. That's because the crown jewel in this scenario is not a product or patent or film library, but a person: Moonves. And the one thing Redstone cannot do is make Moonves, 68, stay if he doesn't want to.\\nThat is why her previous attempt to merge these companies, in 2016, failed. The rationale was to put Viacom's weak business under the highly successful Moonves. But he wanted no part of it, and he's at a point in his career where he needn't accept anything he doesn't want. At a 2016 industry conference, says the Hollywood Reporter , someone asked Moonves onstage why he might oppose the merger. \"Because I'm too old and too rich. How's that?\" he replied. He tried to soften the remark by adding that he was kidding, but all evidence suggests he was not.\\...   \n",
